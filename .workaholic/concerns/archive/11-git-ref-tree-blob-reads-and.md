# /git @<ref> tree/blob reads and nested subtrees still limited

## Description

Time-travel now works for commits/refs/tags and for `@<ref>` tree and single-blob reads ([c5cfa89], [794d8f8], [8075c77]), but blob reads resolve flat-tree (E0) only — nested subtree paths remain out of scope. The docs claim only what runs.

## How to Fix

Extend blobfs dispatch to resolve nested subtree paths; keep the structured `invalid_path` fail-closed for genuinely missing paths.
