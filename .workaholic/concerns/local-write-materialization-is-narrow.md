# /local write materialization is narrow

## Description

Local writes persist, and a positional single-column payload now maps onto the blob ([0373cd2]), but a multi-column payload with no `content` column still errors — the user must name the blob column. Earlier in the branch one-shot `upsert into /local/<file>` reported COMMITTED without writing, which the fallback addressed for the unambiguous case. (`local-write-materialization-is-narrow.md`, origin `3c6f995`)

## How to Fix

Keep the single-column fallback strict (intentional); document that multi-column local writes must name the blob column. Watch the commit.rs → effect.rs content-blob threading for other write paths.
