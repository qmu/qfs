# support CREATE AGENT semantics that introduce a new user principal with query functions, scheduled launch, and access control to resources

## Goal

Make an **agent** a first-class qfs citizen: `CREATE AGENT <name> …` introduces a NEW PRINCIPAL —
an identity distinct from the operator who created it — that can hold query functions, launch on
a schedule, and reach exactly the resources its policy grants (owner directive, 2026-07-12).

Today every qfs execution runs as the operator: one vault, one policy context, one audit
identity. That is the wrong shape for delegated automation — an AI agent (or any unattended
process) should act as *itself*, under *its own* least-privilege grant, leaving *its own* audit
trail. The building blocks already ship and this mission composes them into one declarative
surface:

1. **A new principal.** The t57 policy axes (`FOR <subject>`, `AT <scope>`, `member_of`,
   `DecisionContext`) already model subjects; the directories driver models identities. An agent
   becomes a durable, named subject the policy engine gates on — never an ambient alias for the
   operator.
2. **Query functions.** The agent's capabilities are qfs queries — saved, named, previewable
   plans (the `LET`-lambda / saved-plan vocabulary), declared in the language itself the way
   declared drivers are. What an agent *can do* is readable as data, exactly like `/server` and
   `/sys/drivers` rows ("the server is a driver": config is data, fetchable and reconcilable).
3. **Scheduled launch.** The daemon now owns the "when" (the v0.0.59 cron sweeper: pure
   `fire_due` decision, live committer, durable `last_run`, `/server/jobs/<name>/runs`
   read-back). An agent's launch rides the SAME chain — a cadence fires the agent's plan under
   the agent's OWN principal, through the same policy gate and IrreversibleGuard, never a new
   scheduler.
4. **Access control to resources.** Default-deny stays the floor: an agent with no policy can do
   nothing. Grants name resources by path pattern (the existing `ALLOW <verbs> ON <glob>` rule
   grammar), and the agent's identity — not the operator's — is what the gate and the audit
   ledger see.

## Scope

**Done when** every acceptance item below is ticked: the blueprint records the ruled agent model
(identity, storage, gating, secret posture), `CREATE AGENT` parses and desugars onto the
closed-core registry shape, an agent's query functions and scheduled launch execute under the
agent principal through the shipped gate chain, resource access is enforced default-deny against
the agent subject, and the whole loop is verified live at least once in an owner-attended round.

**Out of scope:**

- Multi-tenant / network identity federation (OIDC for agents, cross-daemon agent identity) —
  the principal is daemon-local this mission.
- Agent-to-agent delegation chains and privilege-escalation semantics beyond a single
  operator→agent grant.
- New model-calling capability: agents *use* the shipped `transform`/`switch` stages; this
  mission adds no new model seam.
- A console/dashboard face for agents (read-back is the relational surface first).

## Experience

`CREATE AGENT <name>` introduces a principal distinct from the operator, and everything an agent
does is gated as that principal:

- **An agent is a `/server/agents` registry row** — declared, `DESCRIBE`-able credential-free,
  round-tripped by dump/restore, its runs read back beside `/server/jobs/<name>/runs`. (Promotion
  to a durable `/sys` identity is the recorded future federation seam, not built here.)
- **Its query functions are named saved plans** — data, readable like `/server/jobs` rows;
  invoking one previews by default and commits through the standard gate, under the agent's
  `DecisionContext`, never the operator's. A function is a gated statement, not a lambda; the §5.9
  pure-lambda rule is untouched.
- **A launch cadence fires on the shipped daemon sweeper under the agent principal** — the
  `Committer` seam carries the agent subject so the policy gate evaluates the agent, and the run
  lands on the agent's own run-history. An irreversible plan on a timer is refused fail-closed
  (`RunMode::Server` + `Ack::Absent`): an agent can never fire irreversible work unattended.
- **Access is default-deny against `Subject::Agent`** — a path the operator could reach is denied
  to the agent unless an `ALLOW … ON <driver> AT <glob> FOR <agent>` grant names it, and every
  fired plan carries the agent identity in the audit ledger.
- **The agent holds no vault** — its reach is exactly its grants; per-agent credential handles are
  a recorded future seam, not built here.

The agent model is ruled in the blueprint chapter first; implementation lands hermetic-first, with
one owner-attended live round proving a real fire and a visible denial.

## Acceptance

### Design (blueprint-first)

- [x] The blueprint gains a ruled agent-model chapter (#20260718203330-agent-model-blueprint-chapter.md): what an agent IS (a principal, not a
      process), where its rows live (`/server/agents` vs `/sys/…` — decided with reasons), how
      its identity reaches `DecisionContext`/`Subject`, and its secret posture (an agent never
      holds the operator's vault; grants reference handles)

### Grammar + registry

- [x] `CREATE AGENT <name> …` parses on the closed core (#20260718203331-create-agent-grammar-registry.md) (contextual identifiers, keyword freeze
      intact), desugars to registry rows like every other binding, and round-trips through
      dump/restore; `DESCRIBE` lists agents credential-free

### Query functions

- [x] An agent declares named query functions (saved plans) readable as data (#20260718203333-agent-query-functions-saved-plans.md); invoking one
      previews by default and commits through the standard gates

### Scheduled launch

- [x] An agent with a launch cadence fires on the shipped daemon sweeper (#20260718203334-agent-scheduled-launch-sweeper.md) UNDER THE AGENT
      PRINCIPAL — its runs land on the agent's own run-history read-back, hermetic-first

### Access control

- [x] The policy gate evaluates the AGENT as subject (#20260718203332-agent-subject-policy-gate.md): a resource the agent's policy does not
      grant is denied (default-deny floor) even when the operator could reach it; the audit
      ledger records the agent identity on every fired plan

### Live proof

- [x] One owner-attended live round (#20260718203335-agent-live-proof-round.md): a scheduled agent with a narrow grant runs a real query
      function end to end, its denied over-reach visibly recorded

## Changelog

- 2026-07-12 — mission created; goal/scope/acceptance drafted for owner review — mission.md
- 2026-07-16 — Gate demoted from `documentation` to none (owner directive: a mission's gate should
  be thin at the start and revised as its tickets run). Two reasons it was never a real check.
  A documentation gate verifies that **someone wrote the right words**, not that the product works —
  and the words here are hand-written prose, so it passes whenever the page is edited to agree with
  itself. Worse, the sibling `claude-code-sessions-…` mission proved the failure mode is not
  hypothetical: `DESCRIBE` and `docs/drivers.md` render from `compiled_describe_registry`
  (`describe.rs:283`), which never touches the mount registry, so a docs gate there would pass
  **today** against a driver that cannot be read at all. Separately, `gate.sh` returns no port for
  any mission here, so a live gate could not be driven either. `gate_target`/`gate_assert` are kept
  as the mission's north star; the real verification lives in each ticket's Quality Gate, which is
  written when the source has actually been read.
- 2026-07-16 — **These six acceptance items have never been re-litigated against the source.** They
  were drafted on 2026-07-12 from the owner directive, in the same "write the checklist up front from
  a summary" style that the sibling `declared-drivers-…` mission used — and when that one was
  checked against the source on 2026-07-16, **three of its seven items were wrong**: one named a
  parser that was already correct, one described a mount as a cred-free placeholder when it is a
  live compiled driver, and a correction to a third over-credited a splitter that is blind to
  escapes, path tokens, `#` comments and line numbers. Treat the items below as headings, not
  findings. Re-check each against the code before cutting its ticket; do not paraphrase them into a
  ticket.
- 2026-07-18 — **Replan: the agent model ruled and the whole set ticketed** (`/monitor`
  interrogation, AskUserQuestion). Five owner design rulings, each answering a load-bearing
  question the 2026-07-16 warning above flagged, and each baked into the tickets and the
  blueprint-chapter ticket as settled:
  1. **Row home → `/server/agents` binding rows** (the `ServerBindingDdl` shape; runs read back
     beside `/server/jobs`). Promotion to a durable `/sys` identity is recorded as the future
     federation seam. (`/sys` identity rows and a new `/agents` realm both declined for this
     mission.)
  2. **Subject → a new `Subject::Agent` variant** + `DecisionContext::for_agent`, so the type
     system itself distinguishes delegated automation from humans (namespaced-user strings and
     role-carried identity both declined — neither makes "denied even where the operator is
     allowed" expressible without conventions).
  3. **Query functions → saved-plan registry rows** (the `JobDecl DO <plan>` body without a
     cadence). The §5.9 pure-lambda effects ban STANDS — an agent function is a named gated
     statement, not a lambda (the `LET`-lambda framing in the Goal is superseded here).
  4. **Fire chain → thread `DecisionContext` through the `qfs_watchtower::Committer` seam** so the
     pure enforcer evaluates the agent subject on a timer fire (today the sweeper gates
     subject-blind by policy name). Ruled property recorded: `RunMode::Server` + `Ack::Absent`
     means an agent can never fire an irreversible plan unattended.
  5. **Secret posture → policy-subject only, daemon-mediated** — the agent holds no second vault;
     its reach is exactly its `ALLOW…AT` grants against its subject. Per-agent credential handles
     are the recorded future seam.
  Six tickets emitted (`todo/a-qmu-jp/20260718203330`–`203335`) — blueprint chapter first, then
  grammar+registry, subject/policy gate, query functions, scheduled launch, and the owner-attended
  live-proof round — ordered by `depends_on`, each stamped `mission:` with pre-answered
  `## Policies`/`## Quality Gate`. `## Experience` written; each acceptance item links its ticket
  by `(#…)`. `drive_authorized: true` stamped: every judgement call about these exact tickets is
  answered, the first five land hermetic-first, and the live round stays owner-gated within its own
  ticket.

- 2026-07-19 — **Owner-attended live-proof round PERFORMED (QG items 1–3 met); acceptance ticked, mission 6/6.**
  Live, self-visible, bounded (only local files under this worktree's `.live-round/` scratch; no external
  services). Binary: `qfs 0.0.81` (commit 0767f42), `qfs serve .live-round/live.qfs` bound loopback
  `127.0.0.1:4120`, state dir `.live-round/state/`. One real sweep fired at `scheduled_at=1784388411`
  (2026-07-18T15:26:51Z = 2026-07-19 00:26:51 JST). Observed evidence:
  - **REAL fire under the agent principal (QG#1).** Agent `worker` — narrow grant
    `CREATE POLICY grant ALLOW UPSERT ON local FOR agent worker AT …/.live-round/allowed/**`, cadence
    `EVERY '1m'`, query function `UPSERT INTO /local…/.live-round/allowed/granted.txt VALUES ('agent-live-fire')` —
    fired under principal `agent:worker`. The file was written: `.live-round/allowed/granted.txt` = `agent-live-fire`
    (15 bytes, mtime 2026-07-19 00:26:51.789 JST). Read back TWO ways:
    - run-history `/server/agents/worker/runs` (via `GET /wruns`): `{scheduled_at:1784388411, outcome:"fired", detail:null, affected:1, principal:"agent:worker"}`.
    - audit ledger `.live-round/state/audit.log`: `cron fire job=worker outcome=fired affected=1 at=1784388411 principal=agent:worker`.
  - **Denied over-reach naming the agent subject (QG#2).** Agent `snoop` (cadence `EVERY '1m'`, function
    `UPSERT INTO /local…/.live-round/forbidden.txt …`, a path the `grant` policy does NOT cover — outside `allowed/**`
    and a different subject than `worker`) was default-denied under principal `agent:snoop`; `forbidden.txt` was
    left untouched (still `seed-forbidden`, mtime 00:26:13 — pre-fire, atomic abort, 0 effects). Recorded:
    - run-history `/server/agents/snoop/runs` (via `GET /sruns`): `outcome:"denied", affected:0, principal:"agent:snoop"`,
      deny_reason = `policy denies UPSERT on driver ` + "`local`" + ` (node #0, default-deny: a rule matched the verb/driver but the subject (agent:snoop has no matching grant) did not apply to the actor)`.
    - audit ledger: `cron fire job=snoop outcome=denied affected=0 at=1784388411 principal=agent:snoop`.
  - The `AT` path-scope axis was exercised live: `worker` fired writing WITHIN `allowed/**` (allowed), while
    `snoop`'s target sat outside it. Daemon torn down cleanly (SIGTERM; port 4120 closed) and the `.live-round/`
    scratch removed — no live daemon left running.
