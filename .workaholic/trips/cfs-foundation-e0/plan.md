# Trip Plan

## Initial Idea

[night /trip — empty instruction; recorded assumption] Develop and build the cfs foundation (epic E0 of the RFD-0001 Rust rebuild): ticket t01 (Rust workspace + single-binary scaffold, CLI+server, typed module/registry/trait seams, lints+CI+cross-compile), and gated on it, ticket t02 (parser-library decision spike: winnow vs chumsky, ADR + thin parser-skeleton crate). Scope fixed at invocation; do not expand.

## Plan Amendments

### A1 — Planning converged at round 1 (Lead, 2026-06-22)
One-turn review (Step 2) returned **unanimous approval**: every per-artifact decision was
"Approve with observations" or "Approve with minor suggestions"; **zero "Request revision"**.
Per the trip-protocol Consensus Gate, planning completes with no respond/escalate/moderate
rounds. Plan is fixed. The plan = `directions/direction-v1.md` + `models/model-v1.md` +
`designs/design-v1.md`, with the carry-over acceptance criteria in A3 below.

### A2 — Dev-environment ground truth (Lead, 2026-06-22, corrects design-v1 risks R8/toolchain)
The Lead verified the build environment directly (the Constructor's design-v1 reasoned from a
momentarily network-restricted subagent shell and over-rated several risks):
- **crates.io is reachable** from both the lead shell and a fresh subagent (`index HTTP 200`);
  a real `cargo fetch` succeeded. The global cargo cache has been **pre-warmed** (76 MB) with the
  full transitive closure: `clap 4.6.1 (derive)`, `thiserror 2.0.18`, `anyhow 1`, `serde 1 (derive)`,
  `serde_json 1`, `tracing 0.1`, `tracing-subscriber 0.3`, `winnow 1.0.3`, `chumsky 0.13.0`.
  → **R8 (offline fetch) is retired.** Use external deps freely; no std-only fallback needed.
  The t02 winnow-vs-chumsky head-to-head can run for real. Builds also work `--offline`.
- **Toolchain pin** must be `channel = "stable"` (NOT `"1.96.0"`) in `rust-toolchain.toml` — the
  Constructor's correct catch; pinning the numeric version triggers a failing offline rustup
  download. Installed: rustc/cargo/clippy/rustfmt 1.96.0; targets `aarch64-` and
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.
- **x86_64 cross-link** has no cross-linker locally → the `cfs` binary links only for native
  aarch64 here; x86_64 binary link is **CI-only** (lib crates still cross-compile). Native
  aarch64 build/test is the local proof.
- **wasm32** target is not installed and is **deferred per the tickets** (t01/t02 out-of-scope);
  the t02 wasm32 size datapoint is CI-only / parked. Not a blocker for E0 acceptance.

### A3 — Carry-over acceptance criteria from round-1 reviews (Lead, 2026-06-22)
Folded into the Coding Phase as acceptance criteria (non-blocking review suggestions; no artifact
revision required):
- **G1 / C1** — the reserved-keyword golden set lives in ONE cited committed fixture in `cfs-lang`;
  the golden test asserts against that single source (no drift between two hand-transcriptions).
- **C4** — a `cargo metadata`-based test fails the build if `cfs-cmd` gains a direct dependency on
  `cfs-lang/plan/driver/codec/parser` (mechanically enforce "cmd is logic-free" + dep direction).
- **G3** — purity invariant proven by a plain in-crate `#[test]` instantiating a no-I/O dummy
  `Driver`/`Codec` (NOT via `trybuild`; the trait signature is the primary enforcer).
- **C5** — declare the intended `cfs-core → cfs-parser` edge direction now so E1 cannot introduce a
  cycle.
- **R5/P1 wording** — morning report states cross-compile status precisely: "native aarch64 built &
  tested locally; x86_64 + wasm32 are CI-only".
- Retained spike loser (winnow or chumsky) carries a banner pointing at the ADR so it is not misread
  as a live second parser.

## Progress (continued — coding phase)

- [x] **[Constructor]** coding/concurrent-launch — implemented t01: 9-crate workspace under `crates/` (cfs bin + cmd/core/lang/plan/driver/codec/server/parser), three open registries, Driver/Codec traits with type-level purity, frozen keyword fixture, Effect/Plan placeholders, clippy deny-warnings + rustfmt + CI. **29 unit/integration tests green**, fmt/clippy/build clean on native aarch64. Decision **D1** recorded (CfsError/Path in cfs-driver to keep spine acyclic). Commit `9557bda`.
- [x] **[Architect]** coding/review-and-testing — analytical review of t01: **Approve with minor suggestions**; acyclic spine verified across all 9 manifests, D1 endorsed, guards G1–G6 + C4/C5 pass, E1/E2/E7 confirmed to land inside seams. Commit `415e9f1`.
- [x] **[Planner]** coding/review-and-testing — E2E validation of t01 CLI: **E2E approved**; 7/7 scenarios pass, no panics, `--json` envelope `{"error":{"code","message"}}` parseable by python3 + jq. Commit (e2e review). Exit-code convention 0/1/2 consistent.
- [x] **[Lead]** t01 ACCEPTED — all three coding gates green, no iteration required.

## Progress

- [x] **[Planner]** planning/artifact-generation — wrote `directions/direction-v1.md` (business vision for cfs E0 foundation: value proposition, business/strategic risk, three user personas including the AI agent operating cfs, system positioning for Rust single-binary + closed-core/open-registries, and the business rationale for a night on E0 before the 39 downstream tickets). Night-mode empty-instruction assumption recorded prominently in the artifact.
