# cfs architecture (Rust workspace)

This document records the **crate-boundary rules** of the `cfs` Rust rebuild. It is
the durable companion to [`RFD-0001`](.workaholic/RFDs/0001-cfs-architecture.md) (the
single source of truth) and to the E0 trip artifacts under
`.workaholic/trips/cfs-foundation-e0/`. Every later ticket must add code **inside**
these boundaries without restructuring the workspace.

> Note: the legacy Go `gmail-ftp` program (`main.go`, `internal/`, `go.mod`) lives
> alongside this workspace and is untouched. Per RFD §0 it is *subsumed as a future
> driver*, not merged. The Rust workspace coexists with it.

## Crate map

| Crate (`crates/<dir>`) | package | Role (RFD §) |
|---|---|---|
| `cfs` (bin) | `cfs` | The single binary; thin `main.rs` calling `cfs_cmd::run` (§9). |
| `cmd` | `cfs-cmd` | argv parsing (clap-derive), dispatch into the engine; **no domain logic** (§7). |
| `core` | `cfs-core` | Shared engine glue: 3 registries, `Engine`/`Session`, re-exports, `CfsError` (§3/§6). |
| `lang` | `cfs-lang` | The frozen reserved-keyword closed core (§3); AST lands here in E1. |
| `plan` | `cfs-plan` | Effects-as-data: the typed `Plan` DAG of `EffectNode`s, `PlanApplier`/`commit`, and `PREVIEW` rendering (§3/§6/§10). Depends on `cfs-types` (leaf) for the row model (t09). |
| `driver` | `cfs-driver` | The `Driver` contract + owned DTOs; owns `CfsError` & `Path` (§5/§9). |
| `codec` | `cfs-codec` | The pure `bytes ↔ rows` `Codec` contract (§4). |
| `types` | `cfs-types` | The canonical type & schema model: `Value`/`Row`/`RowBatch`, `Schema`/`ColumnType`, schema algebra + typed predicates (§4/§5). **Leaf** crate (t05). |
| `server` | `cfs-server` | The server face: `serve` stub + `/server` mount seam (§8). |
| `parser` | `cfs-parser` | Parser front door skeleton; **filled by t02** (§2.2/§9). |

## Dependency spine (acyclic, no back-edges)

```
cfs (bin) → cfs-cmd → cfs-core → { cfs-lang, cfs-plan, cfs-driver, cfs-codec, cfs-types }
                         ▲
                   cfs-server ── depends on cfs-core
cfs-codec  → cfs-driver        (shared CfsError, decision D1 — acyclic)
cfs-codec  → cfs-types         (canonical Value/Row/RowBatch row model, t05 — acyclic)
cfs-driver → cfs-plan          (Driver methods reference plan types)
cfs-plan   → cfs-types         (effect nodes carry the canonical RowBatch/DriverId, t09 — acyclic)
cfs-parser → cfs-lang          (consumes the frozen keyword consts / AST)
cfs-types  → (serde only)      (LEAF: no workspace deps; the vendor-free type model, t05)
```

Arrows point toward more-foundational crates. There are **no cycles** and **no
back-edges**. Mechanically enforced by `crates/cmd/tests/dep_direction.rs` (a
`cargo metadata` test).

### Decision D1 — where `CfsError` / `Path` live

design-v1 nominally placed `CfsError` and `Path` in `cfs-core`, but the `Driver` and
`Codec` trait signatures return `Result<_, CfsError>` and take `&Path`, while the
spine requires `cfs-core → cfs-driver`. Putting them in `cfs-core` would force a
cycle. They therefore live in **`cfs-driver`** (the lowest crate the signatures
need); `cfs-codec` depends on `cfs-driver` for the shared error, and `cfs-core`
**re-exports** both so the workspace still sees one `cfs_core::CfsError` /
`cfs_core::Path`. This preserves "one error enum, shared workspace-wide" while keeping
the spine strictly acyclic.

### Decision D2 — the `cfs-types` leaf (t05)

The canonical type & schema model (`Value`/`Row`/`RowBatch`, `Schema`/`ColumnType`,
`TypeError`, schema algebra, typed predicates) lives in a dedicated **leaf** crate
`cfs-types` (pre-reserved by the Architect). E0 shipped placeholder `Value`/`Row`/
`RowBatch` in `cfs-codec`; t05 promotes them to the canonical typed model and
`cfs-codec` now **re-exports** them from `cfs-types`, so the `bytes ↔ rows` boundary
and the evaluator speak one row model. The crate depends on **no other workspace
crate** (only `serde`/`serde_json`, the latter solely as the carrier for the `Json`
value of irregular columns), keeping it the lowest node in the spine and the type
model vendor-free (RFD §9, G6). To preserve that leaf status, `DriverId` is defined
*inside* `cfs-types` (an owned newtype, never a vendor handle) rather than imported
from `cfs-driver`, and the `SchemaSource` trait takes a logical segment list
(`&[Name]`) instead of the driver `Path`; E4 adapts the driver `Path` at the boundary.
`cfs-core` depends on `cfs-types` and re-exports it so the workspace sees one
`cfs_core::Schema` / `Value` / `TypeError`. Mechanically enforced by
`dep_direction.rs::types_is_a_leaf_and_codec_depends_on_it`.

### Reserved edge — `cfs-core → cfs-parser` (acceptance criterion C5)

The intended edge is declared (a comment in `crates/core/Cargo.toml` and here) but
**not yet wired** in E0. E1 adds it one-directionally so `cfs-parser` can never depend
on `cfs-core` (cycle prevention). `dep_direction.rs` asserts the edge is absent at E0
and that `cfs-parser` does not depend on `cfs-core`.

## Boundary rules (must hold for every later ticket)

1. **Closed core / one keyword home (G1).** The reserved-keyword set lives only in
   `cfs-lang::KEYWORDS`. A new backend adds *zero* keywords — it registers a path,
   procedure, or codec instead. The freeze test (`cfs-lang`) locks the set.
2. **Open registries generic over trait objects (G2).** Extension = `register(...)`
   into one of the three `cfs-core` registries. Registries hold `Arc<dyn Driver>` /
   `Arc<dyn Codec>` / owned `ProcedureDecl`, never concrete types.
3. **Purity invariant at the type level (G3).** `Driver` / `Codec` methods return
   data (or `Plan` nodes); none take `&mut self`, return a future, or perform I/O. The
   only impure op (`COMMIT : Plan -> World`) is reserved for E2 and absent from the
   traits. Proven by the no-I/O dummy-impl tests in `cfs-driver` / `cfs-codec`.
4. **Server is a driver (G4).** `cfs-server` reserves `/server` as a mount and a
   `TODO(E7)` anchor; the server must be registered as a `Driver`, never a bespoke
   subsystem.
5. **cmd is logic-free (G5 / C4).** `cfs-cmd` depends on `cfs-core` + `cfs-server`
   only. Enforced by `dep_direction.rs`.
6. **Parser boundary reversibility (G6).** The chosen parser library's types never
   appear in `cfs-parser`'s public API — wrapped behind an owned `ParseError` and the
   `parse_statement` signature (t02).
7. **No vendor leak / owned DTOs (B3).** No SDK/vendor type crosses the `cfs-driver`
   boundary. DTOs are owned and `#[non_exhaustive]` with `new` constructors.
8. **No credentials (B8).** No secret/credential field anywhere; none in tests or CI.

## wasm-friendliness (B7)

The core crates (`cfs-core`, `cfs-lang`, `cfs-plan`, `cfs-driver`, `cfs-codec`,
`cfs-parser`) avoid threads, `std::fs`, and sockets so the future `wasm32` target
(RFD §1/§9) stays cheap. All real I/O lives behind (future) driver impls. `unsafe`
code is `forbid`-den workspace-wide.

## Cross-compile status

- **native `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`**: built & tested locally (this host is
  Graviton/aarch64). This is the local proof.
- **`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`**: lib crates cross-compile; the full binary link is
  **CI-only** (no x86_64 cross-linker on the local aarch64 host).
- **`wasm32-unknown-unknown`**: **deferred** per t01 — not built locally or in CI yet
  (a parked t02 / future-E0-sibling concern). Code is kept wasm-friendly per B7.

## Lints

Workspace lints (`Cargo.toml` `[workspace.lints]`): `unsafe_code = forbid`; clippy
`all = deny` plus `unwrap_used` / `expect_used` / `panic = deny` on non-test lib code.
Test modules opt out via `#![cfg_attr(test, allow(...))]` (and integration tests via a
file-level `#![allow(...)]`). Gates: `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy
--workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo build --workspace`,
`cargo test --workspace`.
