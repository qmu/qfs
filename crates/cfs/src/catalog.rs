//! `cfs::catalog` — the **driver catalog** the docs are generated from (ticket t40).
//!
//! ## Built from the EXISTING describe surface — no new `Driver::doc()` trait method
//! The ticket's first draft proposed adding a required `Driver::doc() -> DriverDoc` method to
//! the [`cfs_core::Driver`] trait. A new *required* trait method would force **every** driver
//! crate (and everything downstream) to recompile — which the constrained build disk cannot
//! survive. So this catalog is built **without touching the trait**: it walks the binary's own
//! describe registry ([`crate::describe::describe_registry`]) and folds each driver's existing
//! introspective half — the t39 [`cfs_core::DescribeReport`] (`archetype` / `verbs` /
//! `procedures` / `aliases` / `pushdown`) plus the driver's `mount()` — into an **owned**
//! [`DriverDoc`] DTO. No vendor SDK type leaks (RFD §9); no credential is resolved and no I/O
//! happens (DESCRIBE is pure, RFD §3) because only the introspective methods are called.
//!
//! ## Codecs are catalogued from the builtin codec set
//! The `DECODE`/`ENCODE` formats are a single workspace-wide open registry (RFD §4), not a
//! per-driver list, so the catalog records the builtin codec names once via
//! [`cfs_codec::builtin_codecs`] and the docs render them as the shared codec row.
