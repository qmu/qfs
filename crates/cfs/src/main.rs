//! `cfs` — the single binary (RFD-0001 §9: one Rust binary, both CLI and server).
//!
//! This entrypoint forwards argv to [`cfs_cmd::run`] and exits with the code it returns.
//! All argv parsing, dispatch, and rendering live in `cfs-cmd`; all domain logic lives below
//! `cfs-core`.
//!
//! The one piece the binary owns directly is the **interactive-shell launcher** (t28): the
//! shell's local-FS read facet depends on `cfs-driver-local` (a `cfs-runtime` consumer), and
//! only a leaf crate may carry that edge without tripping the runtime-confinement guard. The
//! binary is that leaf, so it builds the wired shell and injects it into `cfs-cmd` via the
//! [`cfs_cmd::ShellLauncher`]. The shell LOGIC itself lives in `cfs-exec`; this only wires it.
