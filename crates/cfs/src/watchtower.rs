//! The `cfs serve` **watchtower composition** (t34): the binary wires the watchtower binding.
//!
//! Like the HTTP + cron bindings, `cfs-watchtower` is a LEAF that consumes `cfs-server` (the
//! registry + reconcile seam) AND `cfs-exec` (the build_plan committer) — composing it HERE (the
//! terminal binary) keeps `cfs-cmd` off it and lets its feature-gated tokio (the LocalBus MPSC +
//! the dispatch loop) dead-end in the sink. The binary:
//!   * builds the shared [`cfs_watchtower::LocalBus`] + the [`cfs_watchtower::WatchtowerBinding`]
//!     (reconciled by the runtime from `/server/{webhooks,triggers}`),
//!   * builds a [`WatchtowerCommitter`] that lowers a fired trigger's plan via `cfs_exec::build_plan`
//!     and commits it (the PREVIEW path — the live-driver applier is the same parked carry-over as
//!     cron/HTTP),
//!   * spawns a **dispatch loop** that drains the bus, matches each event against the live trigger
//!     set, gates the WHERE, binds NEW.*, commits, and acks ONLY on success (at-least-once), and
//!   * builds the HTTP **fallback closure** that routes `/hooks/...` to the webhook `ingest` (so
//!     `cfs-http` gains no dependency on `cfs-watchtower` — option b of the t34 serve decision).
//!
//! ## Parked wiring (carry-over, recorded honestly)
//!   * **The live-driver applier**: the committer here builds the plan and applies it through a
//!     `RecordingApplier` (the PREVIEW path) — the SAME state cron/HTTP are in at this stage. The
//!     live-effect COMMIT through the runtime `Interpreter` is the E2/E4 carry-over (t35/t38).
//!   * **Durable bus + cursor + dedup ledger**: the LocalBus spool, the watcher cursors, and the
//!     dispatcher's idempotency ledger are in-memory in this binary; persisting them via `/server`
//!     (EC2) or Durable Objects + CF Queues (CF) is the deferred deployment detail (E7/t35).
//!   * **Watcher task spawning**: the reconciled watcher SET is exposed (the daemon would spawn one
//!     poll task per watcher); wiring the live poll loop against real read drivers is parked with
//!     the cron daemon's live-driver carry-over (an unregistered source is a structured error,
//!     never a panic).
