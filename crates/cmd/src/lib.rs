//! `cfs-cmd` — the command layer (RFD-0001 §7).
//!
//! Parses argv with clap-derive and dispatches one of three arms into the shared
//! [`cfs_core`] engine:
//! - **interactive shell** (no subcommand) — the FTP-like prompt (RFD §7);
//! - `cfs run '<stmt>'` / `-e` — one-shot statement execution (RFD §7);
//! - `cfs serve <config.cfs>` — boot the server (RFD §8).
//!
//! Every arm returns a structured [`cfs_core::CfsError::NotImplemented`] at E0 (no
//! panics, no `unwrap`/`expect`). This crate holds **no domain logic** (fidelity
//! guard G5): it depends on `cfs-core` and `cfs-server` only and never reaches past
//! `cfs-core` into `cfs-lang` / `cfs-plan` / `cfs-driver` / `cfs-codec` /
//! `cfs-parser` (acceptance criterion C4, enforced by `tests/dep_direction.rs`).
//!
//! Structured `tracing` is initialised once here, at the command boundary only.
