//! lower domain crates. `cfs-cmd` may depend on `cfs-core` (the hub) and
//! `cfs-server` (the serve arm) only.
//!
//! This is an integration test that shells out to `cargo metadata`, inspects the
//! resolved dependency graph, and fails the build if `cfs-cmd` gains a direct edge
//! to `cfs-lang` / `cfs-plan` / `cfs-driver` / `cfs-codec` / `cfs-parser`. It also
//! asserts the broader acyclic spine (nothing depends on `cfs-cmd`, and the leaf

//! `cargo` is invoked via the `CARGO` env var cargo sets for integration tests, so
