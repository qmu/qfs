//! `cfs-core` — the shared engine glue (RFD-0001 §3, §6).
//!
//! This is the hub every face of cfs routes through. It owns the three open
//! registries ([`MountRegistry`], [`ProcRegistry`], [`CodecRegistry`]), the
//! [`Engine`] / [`Session`] execution context that threads them (plus the reserved
//! audit-sink and capability seams), and **re-exports** the trait seams and the
//! structured [`CfsError`] so the rest of the workspace sees one consistent surface.
//!
//! ## Why both faces route through here (boundary B1)
//! The CLI (`cfs run` / interactive shell) and the server (`cfs serve`) are two
//! dispatch arms of the *same* binary reaching the *same* [`Engine`]. `cfs-cmd`
//! depends on this crate only; it never reaches past it into `cfs-lang` / `cfs-plan`
//! / `cfs-driver` / `cfs-codec` directly (fidelity guard G5 / acceptance criterion
//! C4, mechanically enforced by `tests/dep_direction.rs`).
//!
//! ## Reserved upward edge to the parser (acceptance criterion C5)
//! The intended edge is `cfs-core → cfs-parser` (core calls `parse_statement`). It is
//! declared in `Cargo.toml` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` but **not yet wired**, so E1 adds
//! it one-directionally and a cycle is impossible.
//!
//! ## wasm-friendliness (boundary guard B7)
//! No threads, no `std::fs`, no sockets here. All I/O is behind (future) driver impls.
