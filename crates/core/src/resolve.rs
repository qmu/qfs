//! Name resolution (RFD-0001 §3, ticket t06) — the semantic pass that sits between
//! the parsed AST (`cfs-parser`, t04) and the typed schema model (`cfs-types`, t05),
//! turning raw identifiers into resolved registry references.
//!
//! This is where the reserved **`cfs-core → cfs-parser`** edge is wired (acceptance
//! criterion C5): the resolver consumes `cfs_parser::Statement` and resolves three
//! identifier classes against the open registries, adding **zero** keywords to the
//! frozen core:
//!
//! 1. **`CALL driver.action(args)`** — routes the `driver` namespace through the
//!    [`MountRegistry`] longest-prefix router to a `Driver`, then resolves the action
//!    against that driver's declared [`procedures()`](cfs_driver::Driver::procedures)
//!    (`resolve_proc`). Unknown driver / unknown proc / arity / param-name mismatches
//!    each become a structured [`ResolveError`].
//! 2. **Receiver-typed pure aliases** (`SEND`, `MERGE`) — pure registry functions
//!    (never keywords) shipped in a driver's [`prelude()`](cfs_driver::Driver::prelude).
//!    An alias is in scope only for a pipeline whose **receiver driver** ships it; it
//!    desugars to the underlying qualified `CALL` (`d |> SEND` → `d |> CALL mail.send`),
//!    preserving the source span.
//! 3. **Capability gating** — an effect verb (`INSERT`/`UPSERT`/`UPDATE`/`REMOVE`) is
//!    checked against the target node's [`Capabilities`](cfs_driver::Capabilities) via
//!    [`check_capability`](cfs_driver::check_capability) so an unsupported verb fails
//!    *before* a `Plan` exists.
//!
//! ## Purity invariant (RFD §3, the safety property)
//! Every resolved callable is plan-constructing (`… -> Plan`); `CALL`/alias build a
//! `Plan`, they never perform. This module is pure data-in / data-out: it makes **no**
//! driver network calls, reads only the read-only registry, and is unit-testable in
//! isolation. The receiver-typing rule fails **closed** — a multi-/unknown-receiver
//! alias use is rejected ([`ResolveError::AmbiguousAlias`]/[`ResolveError::UnknownReceiver`])
//! rather than guessed.
//!
//! ## Canonical effect-verb mapping (t09 carry-over O2)
//! The canonical `cfs_parser::EffectVerb → cfs_plan::WriteVerb` translation lives here
//! ([`write_verb_for`]) as an **exhaustive match with no `_` arm**, so a future verb
//! cannot be silently dropped. The verb's [`Verb`](cfs_driver::Verb) (for capability
//! gating) is derived from the same total match.
