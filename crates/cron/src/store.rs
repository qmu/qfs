//! [`JobStore`] — the durable persistence seam (RFD §8): enabled JOB rows, per-JOB run state, the
//! single-flight lease, and the run-id-keyed audit ledger. Backed by the `/server` store on EC2
//! (the binary's `LedgerJobStore`) and by a Durable Object on Cloudflare; tests use [`MemJobStore`].
//!
//! The pure scheduler core knows only the trait — it never reaches the `/server` runtime, so this
//! crate stays off `cfs-runtime` and off any wall-clock/global state on the wasm path.
