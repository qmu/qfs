//! The structured Cloudflare driver error (RFD-0001 §5: errors are machine-readable for an AI,
//! never prose, and **never** secret-bearing). Every arm carries a stable [`CfError::code`] and
//! a secret-free message: a path, a verb label, a service + op label, an HTTP status, or a
//! fixed reason — **never** the API token, the `Authorization` header value, a key/message
//! payload, or any credential. The shared [`SqlError`](cfs_sql_core::SqlError) (reused for the
//! D1 SQL compile/emit leg) is mapped in at the boundary so no SQL-internal type leaks past the
//! driver.
