//! The structured Drive driver error (RFD-0001 §5: machine-readable for an AI, never prose,
//! and **never** secret-bearing). Every arm carries a stable [`DriveError::code`] and a
//! secret-free message: a path, a verb label, an HTTP status, an API op, or a fixed reason —
//! **never** a token, a header value, or file bytes. The auth base's
//! [`AuthError`](cfs_google_auth::AuthError) is mapped in at the boundary so no auth-internal
//! type leaks past the driver, preserving the t19 token discipline by construction.
