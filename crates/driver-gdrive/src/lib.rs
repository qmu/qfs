//! `cfs-driver-gdrive` — the **Google Drive blob/namespace `Driver`** (RFD-0001 §5, E4 t21) and,
//! with Gmail (t20), one of the two drivers that **subsume** the legacy Go `gdrive-ftp` tool: it
//! is *reimplemented*, not merged, as one mount at `/drive` under the uniform VFS + pipe-SQL DSL.
//! Drive maps onto the **Blob/namespace archetype** — **folders = directories, files = blobs** —
//! over My Drive (`/drive/my`) and Shared Drives (`/drive/shared/<driveName>`).
//!
//! ## Surface
//! - [`GDriveDriver`] — the introspective `Driver`: `mount()` = `/drive`, the
//!   [`Archetype::BlobNamespace`] per-path archetype + the [`FileMeta`](schema::FileMeta) schema,
//!   **path-keyed** capabilities (a corpus/folder = `Ls|Select|Insert|Upsert|Cp|Mv`; a file =
//!   `Select|Upsert|Update|Remove|Cp|Mv`), the `drive.copy` procedure (the `cp` apply), and
//!   `Partial { where_, limit }` pushdown (the Drive `q` search). `version_support` is
//!   [`VersionSupport::Versioned`] (Drive revisions, the `@rev` coordinate).
//! - [`DriveApplier`] — the synchronous apply leg `applier()` returns and the
//!   [`cfs_runtime::SharedApplier`] the bridge drives under `COMMIT`.
//! - [`gdrive_apply_driver`] — wraps the applier in a [`cfs_runtime::PlanApplierBridge`] ready to
//!   `register` into a `DriverRegistry` under the driver id `drive`, so a plan over `/drive`
//!   executes end-to-end through the t10 interpreter.
//!
//! ## Purity invariant (RFD §3)
//! Every write — `UPSERT INTO /drive/...`, `REMOVE`, `UPDATE` (rename/move), `CALL drive.copy` —
//! **constructs a `Plan` node and performs no I/O during planning**; only [`DriveApplier`] under
//! `COMMIT` touches the Drive API. The introspective methods are pure data (no `&mut self`, no
//! future). `PREVIEW` calls **no** client method (the mock asserts zero calls).
//!
//! ## WHERE → Drive `q` pushdown with a TRUTHFUL residual (the t20 lesson)
//! [`query::build_query`] lowers a typed `WHERE` into the Drive `q` search. A term is pushed as a
//! residual-dropping **exact** mapping **only** when the Drive operator means *exactly* the SQL
//! predicate (`name = 'x'`, `mimeType = 'x'`, `trashed = b`, `'<id>' in parents`). Every looser
//! Drive operator (`name contains`, `fullText contains`, the `modifiedTime` bound) is pushed as a
//! cheap **pre-filter** and the exact predicate is **kept as the local residual** so the engine
//! re-applies exact filtering — over-fetch then filter, never wrong rows (RFD §6).
//!
//! ## Trash, not delete (RFD §10)
//! `REMOVE` defaults to **trash** (recoverable). A permanent, irreversible delete requires an
//! explicit `hard_delete` flag column on the effect; both legs are flagged irreversible so the
//! runtime never auto-retries them and `PREVIEW` warns.
//!
//! ## Auth + multi-account + least privilege (RFD §10)
//! Auth (tokens, refresh, multi-account) comes from t19. The bearer is injected by the t19
//! `GoogleApiClient` and lives behind a [`cfs_secrets::Secret`]; it is **never** logged, never in
//! a DTO, never in plan output or a [`DriveError`]. Multi-account is the t19 base: one
//! `GoogleApiClient` per account email; the driver is account-agnostic (the resolved account is
//! bound at client construction).
//!
//! ## No vendor leak (RFD §9)
//! Drive JSON is translated into owned DTOs at the [`client`] boundary; the `Driver` surface and
//! the `Plan` carry zero google types. The HTTP client is behind the mockable [`GDriveClient`]
//! trait so it mocks in tests (no live Drive, no network) and `reqwest` stays in
//! `cfs-driver-http` — this crate rides the t19 `HttpExchange` seam.
//!
//! ## Named parks (deferred)
//! - **Live path resolution (`name → id` walk) — surface present, no live test.** The pure parse
//!   ([`DrivePath`]) and the resolved-id effect columns exist; the snapshot folder-tree walk that
//!   fills them is exercised through the mocked `list_files` seam, not a live Drive.
//! - **Streaming / resumable upload chunking — modelled as a single seam call.** [`GDriveClient`]
//!   exposes `upload`/`update_content`; the chunked resumable-session retry loop is a follow-up.
//! - **`@rev` revision history walk — column + parse present.** The `rev` column and the `@<rev>`
//!   parse exist; `revisions.list` enumeration is deferred to the read-path follow-up.
