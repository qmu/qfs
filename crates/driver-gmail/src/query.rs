//! WHERE → Gmail search `q=` pushdown (RFD-0001 §6 "push down what the backend runs
//! natively; combine residual filters locally").
//!
//! Gmail's `messages.list` accepts a `q=` parameter in Gmail's search syntax (`from:`,
//! `subject:`, `after:`, `is:unread`, …). The planner lowers a typed `WHERE` predicate into
//! this query string for the subset of operators Gmail covers; predicates Gmail cannot express
//! are returned as **residual** for the engine to filter locally. This module is the pure
//! translation — it builds the `q=` string and reports the residual; it performs **no I/O** and
//! holds no token.
//!
//! ## Mapping (the covered subset)
//! Two classes of pushed term, and the residual discipline differs between them:
//!
//! **Exact** — the Gmail term means *exactly* the SQL predicate, so the predicate is fully
//! pushed and drops out of the residual (nothing to re-check locally):
//! - `label = 'INBOX'`     → `label:INBOX`     (exact label-id membership)
//! - `is_unread = true`    → `is:unread`       (exact `UNREAD`-label membership; `false` → `is:read`)
//! - a bare label scan (`/mail/<label>`) → its `label:<id>` term (exact directory scope)
//!
//! **Pre-filter (lossy)** — the Gmail term is *looser* than the SQL predicate, so it is pushed
//! as a cheap backend pre-filter to narrow the fetch, but the original predicate is **kept as
//! residual** and re-applied locally so only exactly-matching rows survive (over-fetch then
//! filter — RFD §6; never wrong rows):
//! - `from = 'x@y'` → `from:x@y` (Gmail `from:` is an address/substring match, not exact
//!   `From`-header equality), and `to = 'x@y'` → `to:x@y` likewise.
//! - `subject = 'hello'` → `subject:hello` (Gmail `subject:` is a substring match —
//!   `subject:hello` matches `"hello world"`).
//! - `from`/`to`/`subject ~ 'p'` (`Match`) and `LIKE 'p'` → the same loose field operator
//!   (Gmail has no regex/`LIKE`-glob operator, so the term is a substring approximation).
//! - `date > <ts>` → `after:<unix>` and `date < <ts>` → `before:<unix>` (epoch-seconds; Gmail
//!   `after:`/`before:` are date-granular, so the bound is approximate).
//! - `<a> AND <b>` → space-join (Gmail ANDs terms; each conjunct keeps its own residual).
//!
//! `OR`/`NOT`/`IN`/`BETWEEN`/unsupported columns push nothing and stay wholly **residual**.
