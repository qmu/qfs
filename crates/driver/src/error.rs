//! [`CfsError`] — the one structured, machine-readable error enum shared
//! workspace-wide (RFD-0001 §5: errors must be parseable by an AI, not prose).
//!
//! ## Why this lives in `cfs-driver` (decision D1)
//! The design (design-v1 §2.3) nominally placed `CfsError` in `cfs-core`, but the
//! `Driver` and `Codec` trait signatures both return `Result<_, CfsError>`, and the
//! acyclic dependency spine (model-v1 §4) requires `cfs-core → cfs-driver`. Placing
//! the error in `cfs-core` would force a back-edge `cfs-driver → cfs-core` — a cycle
//! the model explicitly forbids. The error therefore lives in the lowest crate the
//! trait signatures need (`cfs-driver`), `cfs-codec` depends on `cfs-driver` for it,
//! and `cfs-core` **re-exports** it so the rest of the workspace still sees a single
//! `cfs_core::CfsError`. This preserves "one error enum, shared workspace-wide"
//! while keeping the spine strictly acyclic.
