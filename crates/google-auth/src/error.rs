//! [`AuthError`] — the structured, **secret-free** Google-auth error taxonomy
//! (RFD-0001 §5/§10/§103).
//!
//! Every variant carries machine-facing detail only — an endpoint name, an account email
//! (a low-sensitivity identifier), a secret-free store/transport code, or a fixed reason.
//! A `client_secret`, an authorization `code`, an access token, or a refresh token can
//! **never** reach an error's `Display`/`Debug`: the variants take only the shapes above,
//! and the live material lives behind [`cfs_secrets::Secret`], which has no `Display`/
//! `Into<String>`. A redaction test asserts a planted secret never surfaces here.

/// Why a Google-auth operation failed. Secret-free by construction: built from endpoint
/// names, status codes, account emails, and store/transport codes — never a token.
