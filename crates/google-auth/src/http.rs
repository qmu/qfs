//! The thin, **synchronous, runtime-free** HTTP transport seam this crate sends auth requests
//! through. The owned request/response DTOs ([`HttpMethod`]/[`HttpRequest`]/[`HttpResponse`]) and
//! the header-redaction authority ([`SENSITIVE_HEADERS`]/[`is_sensitive_header`]) come from the
//! shared **leaf** [`cfs_http_core`] — the **single source of truth** also depended on by
//! `cfs-driver-http`. The transport *trait* itself ([`HttpExchange`]) and its in-memory
//! [`MockExchange`] stay **local** so this crate does not depend on `cfs-driver-http`.
//!
//! ## Why a local seam instead of depending on `cfs-driver-http`
//! `cfs-driver-http` depends on `cfs-runtime` (for the `PlanApplierBridge` + the `EffectError`
//! lowering), and the workspace's confinement test requires **every** `cfs-runtime` consumer to be
//! a *leaf* — no crate may depend back onto it, or tokio could transit out of the runtime, through
//! that crate, and back into the pure spine. If `cfs-google-auth` depended on `cfs-driver-http`,
//! the latter would stop being a leaf and the invariant would break. So this crate keeps its own
//! [`HttpExchange`] trait + [`MockExchange`] (the part with no runtime in it), and the consuming
//! Gmail/Drive/Analytics drivers — themselves runtime leaves already holding an
//! `Arc<dyn cfs_driver_http::HttpClient>` — supply an adapter implementing [`HttpExchange`] over
//! it (a trivial DTO copy). `reqwest` thus stays confined to `cfs-driver-http` exactly as before.
//!
//! ## Single-source DTOs + redaction (t19 refinement)
//! Before the refinement this module hand-copied the t18 DTOs + `SENSITIVE_HEADERS` + the redacting
//! `Debug`, and the copies had already drifted (a 2-variant `HttpMethod` here vs. t18's
//! `#[non_exhaustive]` 4-variant set). The hazard was a **token leak by drift**: if one side added
//! a sensitive header and the other's copy lagged, the lagging adapter would copy that header
//! *value* across the seam and its redaction would silently miss it. The DTOs + redaction now live
//! in [`cfs_http_core`] only; this module re-exports them, so [`cfs_http_core::is_sensitive_header`]
//! is the lone redaction authority for both HTTP seams.
