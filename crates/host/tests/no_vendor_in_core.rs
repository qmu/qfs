//! t36 **no-vendor-in-core deny-test**: the `worker` (CF Workers SDK), `hyper`/`axum` (HTTP
//! servers), and CF/AWS vendor storage crates must NOT be reachable from the server CORE crates
//! (`cfs-core` / `cfs-server`) — they live ONLY behind the `cfs-host` host features and the leaf
//! binding crates.
//!
//! This mirrors the existing `cfs-cmd/tests/dep_direction.rs` guards but resolves the FULL
//! transitive dependency graph (`cargo metadata` WITHOUT `--no-deps`) so a vendor crate pulled in
//! transitively — not just as a direct edge — is caught. It is the "effects-as-data interpreter
//! runs on a vendor-free core" invariant (RFD §9: the single source over two runtimes keeps no
//! `worker::`/`hyper::` symbol in core).
//!
//! NOTE: `tokio` is NOT in the forbidden set here. `cfs-server` legitimately carries `tokio`
//! (`signal`, for the run loop), and `cfs-core`'s tokio-freedom is already pinned by
//! `cfs-plan`'s purity dep-closure test + the runtime-leaf-confinement guard. This test adds the
//! NEW t36 confinement: the CF `worker` SDK and the HTTP-server vendor crates never reach core.

// Test code: assertions and setup may panic/expect/unwrap freely.
