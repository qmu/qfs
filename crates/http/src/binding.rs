//! The [`HttpBinding`] (t32): the [`cfs_server::Binding`] (kind `Http`) that reconciles the
//! `/server/endpoints` registry into a live, hot-swapped route table.
//!
//! ## Reconcile = converge + atomic swap (the t30 rule)
//! `reconcile(&state)` is **synchronous** (the t30 / CO-t30-1 contract): it is handed an owned
//! [`cfs_server::ServerState`] snapshot and rebuilds a fresh [`Router`] from
//! `state.endpoints`, then swaps a shared `Arc<Router>` pointer atomically. The async request
//! handler reads that pointer by cloning the `Arc` (a brief lock, never held across an
//! `.await`) — so a `/server/endpoints` mutation re-binds the live routes on the very next
//! request with zero downtime and no torn state. A write-lowering endpoint is REFUSED at this
//! reconcile (the registration-time policy gate); a refused endpoint is skipped (it never
//! becomes a route) and logged, so one bad row does not tear down the table.
//!
//! ## arc-swap without an external crate
//! `arc-swap` is not in the offline cache; a `std::sync::RwLock<Arc<Router>>` gives the same
//! observable semantics — readers clone the `Arc` under a momentary read guard and drop it
//! immediately, the reconcile takes the write guard for the pointer assignment only. The
//! router itself is immutable once built, so a request holds a consistent snapshot for its
//! whole lifetime even as a concurrent reconcile swaps in a new one.
