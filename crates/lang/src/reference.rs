//! `cfs-lang::reference` — the language **reference surface** (ticket t40).
//!
//! This module exposes the two pieces `cargo xtask gen-docs` renders `docs/language.md`
//! from, so the published reference is **derived from the binary's own data**, never
//! hand-authored twice (anti-drift, RFD §3 governance):
//!
//! - [`RESERVED_KEYWORDS`] — the §3 frozen reserved-word set. It is a **re-export alias**
//!   of [`crate::keywords::KEYWORDS`], the single committed fixture the freeze test locks.
//!   There is deliberately **no second transcription**: adding a keyword to `KEYWORDS`
//!   (the one source) flows straight into the generated docs, and the t40 docs-drift golden
//!   makes the doc fail CI until it is regenerated. The frozen-keyword test in this module
//!   asserts the alias and the source are the very same slice.
//! - [`grammar_ebnf`] — the pipe-SQL grammar in EBNF, the legible contract the AI agent
//!   reads. It is a `&'static str`; the `gen-docs` renderer embeds it verbatim into
//!   `docs/language.md` between fenced markers, so the committed grammar cannot drift from
//!   this constant.
//!
//! Both are pure data (no I/O, no deps) — this crate must stay wasm-clean (boundary guard
//! B7), so the reference surface adds nothing impure.
