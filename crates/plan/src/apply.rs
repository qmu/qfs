//! `COMMIT` semantics (RFD-0001 §6): the [`PlanApplier`] seam — the **only** impure
//! operation in the effect substrate — and [`commit`], which walks a [`Plan`] in
//! topological order applying each node, respecting dependencies and recording
//! applied/skipped accounting in a [`CommitReport`].
//!
//! The plan itself is pure data; `commit` takes an `&mut A: PlanApplier` so that all
//! side effects (and all secrets) live behind the applier boundary, never in the plan.
//! E0/E1 ship [`RecordingApplier`] — a test double that performs **no I/O**, records
//! every call, and returns the node's declared [`Affected`] — so PREVIEW/COMMIT can be
//! exercised end-to-end with no live credentials and no network (acceptance criterion).
