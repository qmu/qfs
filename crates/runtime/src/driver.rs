//! The runtime-side **batch driver** seam (RFD-0001 §5/§9) and the [`DriverRegistry`]
//! the interpreter resolves effects through.
//!
//! This is the consumer-side narrow async trait the interpreter calls; it is the apply-time
//! counterpart of the introspective `cfs_driver::Driver` (t13). Keeping it here — rather
//! than in `cfs-driver` — is what lets the interpreter own async/tokio while `cfs-plan`
//! and `cfs-driver` stay I/O-free (the purity invariant, RFD §3). A real E4 driver bridges
//! its synchronous `cfs_plan::PlanApplier` to [`ApplyDriver`] with a thin adapter; tests
//! use an in-memory mock. **No vendor SDK type crosses this boundary** — the runtime keys
//! batching on the owned [`DriverId`] + `EffectKind`, never a driver-internal type (§9).
