//! The server audit ledger (RFD-0001 §6/§10): an append-only record of every `/server`
//! mutation (who/op/node/before-after) and every fired plan. Owned, **secret-free** data —
//! it records *names* and *ops*, never a row's credential-bearing contents (RFD §10).

//! The ledger is the applied-effect record the operator (and a future recovery pass) reads.
//! It is drained on shutdown (`Runtime::run` flushes it on `ctrl_c`).
