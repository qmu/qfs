//! `cfs-server` — the server face of cfs (RFD-0001 §8).
//!
//! `cfs serve <config.cfs>` boots a long-lived server whose endpoints, triggers, jobs,
//! views, policies, and webhooks are **data** managed with cfs — because the **server is a
//! driver** over `/server/...`. Booting a config file is replaying `INSERT INTO /server/...`
//! statements; the frozen `CREATE …` DDL is sugar over those writes ([`lower`]).
//!
//! ## The runtime is a pure consumer of plans (the hard part, RFD §6/§8)
//! [`Runtime::boot`] reads the file → parses → lowers each statement to a `/server` write
//! [`Plan`](cfs_core::Plan) → `COMMIT`s it through [`ServerConfigApplier`] (the same applier
//! seam a live write uses). The **only** way [`ServerState`] changes is an
//! [`EffectKind::ServerConfigWrite`](cfs_core::EffectKind::ServerConfigWrite) applied at
//! `COMMIT` — there is no privileged config loader. This is also where **real
//! COMMIT-applies-state** begins: unlike the shell/CLI's in-memory `RecordingApplier`, the
//! `/server` applier actually mutates `ServerState` under its `RwLock`.
//!
//! ## E7 seam: bindings (`ENDPOINT`/`TRIGGER`/`JOB`/`WEBHOOK` causes)
//! The cause-execution semantics (HTTP serving, cron firing, webhook ingestion) land in
//! E7 sibling tickets t31–t35 behind the [`Binding`] trait: after every committed `/server`
//! mutation the runtime calls [`Binding::reconcile`] with a read snapshot, so bindings
//! converge to the registry declaratively. `cfs-server` stays **free of HTTP/cron deps**.
//!
//! ## Confinement (boundary B5)
//! `cfs-server` is consumed by `cfs-cmd` (the `serve` arm), so it must **not** depend on
//! `cfs-runtime` (that would make a non-leaf a runtime consumer and trip the confinement
//! guard). The `/server` writes are in-memory and apply through the **pure**
//! [`cfs_core::commit`] seam — no async interpreter is needed.
