//! Handler PREVIEW fixtures (t38, RFD §8): `preview_handler(ddl_src) -> Plan` — drive a
//! `CREATE ENDPOINT/TRIGGER/JOB` binding to the `Plan` a fired binding would COMMIT, **no
//! socket, no live backend**.
//!
//! ## PREVIEW-as-test (RFD §8)
//! A server binding (`CREATE ENDPOINT`/`TRIGGER`/`JOB`) **desugars** to exactly one
//! `/server/<kind>` config-write effect-plan (the canonical closed-core rule, RFD §6/§8). That
//! desugar is **pure** — it builds effects-as-data and runs no I/O — so the strongest test of a
//! handler is to assert the `Plan` it produces, never opening a listen socket or hitting a
//! backend. This consolidates the t30–t34 binding-seam tests: instead of standing up an HTTP
//! listener / cron interval / event bus, assert the plan the binding would commit.
//!
//! The fixture "event" is the binding DDL itself — driving `CREATE ENDPOINT … ON GET /x`
//! through the desugar is exactly what the runtime does when the binding is created, and the
//! resulting plan is what every later firing reconciles against.
