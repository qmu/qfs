//! A wasm-clean **scripted** mock HTTP transport (t38, RFD §5/§9): match request → canned
//! response, record every request, no socket.
//!
//! ## Why a small in-house transport, not `httptest`/`wiremock` (ADR-0006)
//! `httptest`/`wiremock` are absent from the offline cargo cache **and** are socket-bound
//! (they bind a real loopback listener), so neither is affordable on the tight disk nor usable
//! in the no-socket, wasm-pure harness. The driver tickets all hand-rolled a scripted, in-
//! memory transport instead (`cfs-driver-http::MockHttpClient` is the canonical one). This is
//! that pattern, lifted to a wasm-clean leaf built only on the pure [`cfs_http_core`] DTOs —
//! the real reqwest [`HttpClient`] stays in `cfs-driver-http`, never pulled here.
//!
//! The transport is scripted FIFO: queue canned responses, drive the driver, then assert the
//! recorded requests (method/url/headers/body) — the recorded auth headers prove the driver
//! injects credentials, and the redacting [`cfs_http_core::HttpRequest`] `Debug` proves they
//! are never logged.
