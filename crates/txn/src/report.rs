//! The per-commit **recovery report** (RFD-0001 §6 observability, §10 audit-of-record).
//!
//! Emitted by the saga / ACID executors and surfaced in the interpreter's `-json` output.
//! Records the disposition of every leg (applied / already-applied / conflict / failed /

//! or whether the transaction rolled back. Owned, serializable, **secret-free** — the audit
//! trail, never payloads or credentials.
