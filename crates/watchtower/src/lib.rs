//! # cfs-watchtower (t34, RFD-0001 §8)
//!
//! The **watchtower**: the "cause" side of the server runtime that turns external change into
//! fired effect-plans. Two cause sources — inbound **WEBHOOKs** ([`webhook`], HMAC-verified
//! ingress) and polling source **WATCHERs** ([`watcher`], cursor-diff over the read path) — emit
//! normalized owned [`Event`](event::Event)s onto an internal [`EventBus`](bus::EventBus);
//! registered **TRIGGERs** ([`dispatch`]) match an event, evaluate the optional `WHERE` over
//! `NEW.*` ([`predicate`]), bind `NEW.*` into the handler plan ([`bind`]), pass the policy gate
//! hook, and `COMMIT` through an INJECTED [`Committer`](commit::Committer).
//!
//! ## At-least-once + idempotency (RFD §6)
//! Delivery is at-least-once: ack ONLY after a successful COMMIT; the [`bus::LocalBus`] durable
//! spool redelivers an un-acked event after a crash; a [`dedup_key`](event::Event::dedup_key)
//! carried end-to-end + the dispatcher's idempotency ledger make a re-delivered event a no-op after
//! its first net effect. Non-idempotent procs (`CALL mail.send`) still need an explicit dedupe
//! guard in the plan.
//!
//! ## Topology (a LEAF, the watchtower sibling of cfs-http/cfs-cron)
//! Consumed ONLY by the `cfs` binary (the serve composition root). It depends on cfs-server +
//! cfs-exec (a leaf integration consumer of the read path, the role cfs-cmd/cfs-http/cfs-cron play)
//! but NOT on cfs-runtime — the real commit path is the INJECTED [`Committer`](commit::Committer),
//! so the cfs-exec-consumer + runtime-leaf confinement guards stay green and its feature-gated
//! tokio dead-ends in the terminal binary. It also depends on NEITHER cfs-http NOR a vendor HTTP
//! type: the [`WebhookBinding::ingest`](webhook::WebhookBinding::ingest) is a pure handler over
//! owned request data the BINARY composes into the cfs-http listener.
//!
//! ## Purity / wasm
//! The PURE core ([`event`], [`predicate`], [`bind`], the [`bus::EventBus`]/[`watcher::WatcherStore`]/
//! [`commit::Committer`]/[`commit::PolicyGate`] traits, the dedup logic) has ZERO tokio and builds
//! for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with `--no-default-features` (the CF Queues/DO mapping). The native
//! [`bus::LocalBus`] + [`watcher::Watcher::poll_once`] + the [`Committer`](commit::RecordingCommitter)
//! are behind the default-on `native` feature (the t25/t33 absence-of-`native` wasm fence).
