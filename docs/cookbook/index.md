skill_name: qfs-cookbook
skill_description: Use for an overview of what qfs can do and which qfs cookbook skill fits a task — reading, searching, transforming, or writing across Gmail, Google Drive, databases, files, git, GitHub, Slack, and automation with one pipe-SQL language. Routes to the per-service skills.

# Cookbook

Real tasks, and the one qfs statement that solves each. Every recipe is grouped by what you're
working with; use the sidebar to jump around.

A section heading marked **🚧** has a part that isn't wired yet — the recipes shown work, but the
section's callout notes what's still coming (today that's object-store writes and reading a git
blob's bytes at a `@ref`).

## How to read a recipe

Each recipe is a short statement. Multi-stage queries are written one stage per line, with the `|>`
pipe leading each line — read it top to bottom like a series of steps:

```qfs
/mail/inbox
|> where subject LIKE '%invoice%'
|> select date, from, subject
|> order by date DESC
|> limit 20
```

::: tip Reads return rows; writes preview
A **read** runs immediately and returns rows — `/local`, `/sys`, a `/sql` table, and a `/git` repo
all read today. A read of a cloud service you haven't connected (mail, GitHub, Slack, S3, Drive)
returns an *actionable* error telling you exactly which `qfs connection add …` to run — it never
silently fails.

A **write** (`insert`, `update`, `upsert`, `remove`, `call`) **previews** by default: `qfs run`
shows the plan and changes nothing. Add `--commit` to act, and `--commit-irreversible` for things
that can't be undone, like sending mail or merging a PR. So paste any recipe and safely see what it
*would* do first.

## The chapters

One cookbook per service — each opens with how to connect it, then the recipes.

- **[Gmail](/cookbook/gmail)** — connect a Google account, then search, triage, draft, send, label,
  clean up.
- **[Google Drive](/cookbook/gdrive)** — browse My Drive and Shared Drives, download, upload, create
  folders, trash.
- **[Databases](/cookbook/databases)** — filter, aggregate, update, set operations.
- **[git](/cookbook/git)** — versioned file tree and history; read the tree at a ref; record a commit.
- **[GitHub](/cookbook/github)** — list and filter pull requests and issues; merge a PR.
- **[Slack](/cookbook/slack)** — read a channel's latest messages; post a message.
- **[Files & object storage](/cookbook/files)** — local files and S3/R2, plus format conversion with
  codecs.
- **[Cross-service](/cookbook/cross-service)** — join a database to GitHub, a file to a table, one
  query spanning several services.
- **[Automation (server)](/cookbook/automation)** — turn any query into a trigger, a scheduled job,
  an HTTP endpoint, or a cached view.
