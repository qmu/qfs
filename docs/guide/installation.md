# Installation

qfs is a single binary. There's nothing to configure to get started — you can describe and preview
queries with no credentials at all.

## Install script (recommended)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmu/qfs/main/packages/qfs/install.sh | sh
```

The script detects your OS and architecture, downloads the matching release, **verifies its
checksum before extracting**, and installs `qfs` to `~/.local/bin`. It never asks for or fetches
any credential.

::: tip Requires a published release
The script downloads from the project's GitHub Releases. If no release has been published yet,
[build from source](#build-from-source) instead — it's one command. (Releases are cut by pushing a
`v*` tag, which builds the Linux and macOS binaries in CI and attaches them.)
:::

To install somewhere else:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmu/qfs/main/packages/qfs/install.sh | QFS_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
```

Make sure the install directory is on your `PATH`. Then check it works:

```sh
qfs --version
```

## Build from source

You'll need a recent Rust toolchain. The qfs workspace lives under `packages/qfs/`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/qmu/qfs
cd qfs/packages/qfs
cargo build --release        # produces target/release/qfs
./target/release/qfs --version
```

## Supported platforms

Released binaries are built for:

- **Linux** — `x86_64` and `aarch64` (static musl, no system dependencies)
- **macOS** — `x86_64` (Intel) and `aarch64` (Apple Silicon)

## First check (no credentials needed)

You can immediately explore the language without connecting anything. `describe` and `preview` are
completely offline:

```sh
# What can I do with a mail draft?
qfs describe /mail/drafts

# Preview a query — shows the plan, changes nothing
qfs run "insert into /mail/drafts values ('alice@example.com', 'Hi', 'Body text')"
```

When you're ready to act on real services, [connect a service](/guide/connect).

## Use qfs from Claude Code (the plugin)

qfs ships a **Claude Code plugin** that bundles the qfs *skills* — the describe→preview→commit how-to
an agent loads on demand — so Claude can drive the `qfs` CLI over your connected services. Add the
marketplace and install it:

```
/plugin marketplace add qmu/qfs
/plugin install qfs@qfs
```

This lands in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "qfs": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "qmu/qfs" } }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "qfs@qfs": true
  }
}
```

The plugin carries knowledge, not credentials: its skills shell out to the `qfs` binary you
installed above, so finish a one-time [connect setup](/guide/connect) for the services you
want. The agent inherits qfs's safety model unchanged — every write previews first, and irreversible
actions (sending a draft, trashing, merging a PR) still need an explicit `--commit-irreversible`, so
an agent can't fire them by accident.
