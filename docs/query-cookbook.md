# The qfs query cookbook

[[toc]]

A broad, worked-by-example catalogue of qfs queries, in the grammar you would actually type. See
[How qfs works](/guide/concepts) for the model behind them. The recipes deliberately **combine
features and interact** — a federation join feeding a transaction, a policy driven by a directory
group, an agent's MCP commit gated by a safety mode — because the interactions are the product.

::: warning Worked recipes, with a few running ahead of the parser
Every recipe is tagged by the capability that delivers it. The [generated reference](/language) is
always the truth about the binary *today*. Most of this catalogue is now live (the M0→M+ surface
shipped), but a handful of recipes use grammar the parser does not ship yet — they are tagged so you
can tell which is which. Each ` ```qfs ` block carries a machine-readable header
comment — `# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core|extended; milestone=…; features=…` — and a test
(`packages/qfs/crates/test/tests/roadmap_cookbook.rs`) extracts every block: **`grammar=core` recipes must parse
with today's parser** (so the catalogue can never drift from the real grammar), while
`grammar=extended` recipes need a construct the parser does not ship yet — the M6 functional core
(`LET`, lambdas, `TRANSACTION`) *and* other not-yet-shipped grammar (inline `GROUP BY`/`AGGREGATE`,
`||`, source `AS` aliases, richer DDL, …) — and are tracked as a living coverage report, each promoted
to a hard assertion as the milestone that delivers it lands. `grammar=core` means *the grammar of
the statement* is shipped — a recipe may still address a path whose driver arrives later (`/sys`,
`/hosts`, `/directories`), since a path is just a token to the parser.
:::

The safety floor holds in every recipe: **describe is pure, preview touches nothing, commit is
explicit, and irreversible effects (`CALL mail.send`, merges, deletes) demand
`--commit-irreversible`** — even when a line is not spelled out, that is the contract it runs under.

## Reads, filters & projection

The simplest thing qfs does is read one source, narrow it with a predicate, and shape the columns you keep — and that single skill works identically against a mailbox, a Postgres table, a GitHub repo, a Slack channel, a git tree, an object store, or a planned admin mount. These recipes stay inside one source per query and lean on the read vocabulary: `WHERE`/`SELECT`/`EXTEND`/`ORDER BY`/`LIMIT`/`DISTINCT`, the full predicate set (`LIKE`, `~`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `ANY`, `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`), dotted path navigation into nested objects, `EXPAND` of nested collections, and the temporal coordinate (`@version` and `AS OF`). Everything here is read-only, so `PREVIEW` shows exactly what would come back and nothing is ever touched.

**Triage the inbox: unread mail from outside the company, newest first.**

## Cross-service federation

This is the whole reason qfs exists: one query language that JOINs, UNIONs, and set-subtracts across services that otherwise never speak to each other. Because every service is a path and every path yields rows, a SQL table can JOIN a GitHub issue list, a Slack message log can be reconciled against a git history, and a Drive folder can be diffed against a catalog with EXCEPT. The recipes below stay in today's frozen grammar (`grammar=core`) — the milestone tag reflects which services must be live for the recipe to actually run — and lean on `JOIN … ON`, `UNION`, `EXCEPT`, `INTERSECT`, plus aggregation and filtering on top of the federated result.

**How a mixed-source query resolves — pushed down per source, combined locally, identical on every face.** This is the canonical federation recipe: it documents the execution model (see [How qfs works → Federation](/guide/concepts#_5-federation-one-query-many-services)), not just the syntax.

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M4; features=where,join,on,select,order by
/sql/pg/orders
|> where status == 'paid' AND placed_at >= '2026-01-01'
|> join /github/acme/support/issues on orders.email == issues.reporter_email
|> where issues.state == 'open'
|> select orders.id, orders.total, issues.number, issues.title
|> order by orders.total DESC
```

qfs resolves this in two stages, and the resolution is the **same** whether you run it from the CLI on your laptop, a self-hosted server, or a cloud Worker:

1. **Pushdown per source.** The `/sql/pg/orders` subtree (`WHERE status = 'paid' AND placed_at >= …`) becomes **one SQL query** executed inside Postgres; the `/github/acme/support/issues` subtree becomes a **filtered GitHub API fetch**. Each backend does what it can natively (`qfs describe` shows the **pushdown** line for each).
2. **Local combine.** The cross-source `JOIN … ON orders.email = issues.reporter_email`, the post-join `WHERE issues.state = 'open'`, the `SELECT`, and the `ORDER BY` run **in qfs's own engine, in-process** — only the residual that genuinely spans the two services. The same binary, the same planner, the same combine engine do this on every face; at cloud scale only the tenant→DB routing differs — never the resolution itself.

**Match paid orders to the GitHub issues their customers filed.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M4; features=join,on,where,select
/sql/pg/orders
|> where status == 'paid'
|> join /github/acme/support/issues on orders.email == issues.reporter_email
|> select orders.id, orders.total, issues.number, issues.title, issues.state
```

**Find support tickets opened by customers who have never actually purchased.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M4; features=select,except

```

**Reconcile a Drive reports folder against the catalog of reports we expect to exist.**

## Aggregation & analytics

Once a pipeline can `AGGREGATE … AS …` it stops being a filter and becomes a report. This theme rolls
raw rows into counts, sums, averages and rates — grouped by author, channel, sender, prefix or day —
then sorts and trims them into the shape a human actually reads. Because aggregation is just another
stage, the same `GROUP BY` / `ORDER BY` / `LIMIT` vocabulary works over a SQL table, a Slack channel,
a git history or an S3 bucket, and you can filter *after* aggregating (HAVING-style) by chaining a
second `WHERE`. The richest recipes cross services — joining what GA measured against what the
database recorded — to answer questions no single system can.

**Count active customers per country, busiest first.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M4; features=where,aggregate,group by,order by

## Codecs & blob↔relational

A blob is just bytes until you `DECODE` it; then it is a relation you can filter, join and aggregate like any table. `ENCODE` runs the bridge the other way — a relation becomes `json`, `csv`, `yaml`, `toml`, `jsonl` or `md` bytes you can `UPSERT` back into any blob sink. The codec is independent of the source, so the same `DECODE md` works on a local file, an S3 object, a Drive doc, a git file pinned at a ref, GitHub file contents or the body of a REST/JSON response. For markdown, `DECODE md` lifts each document's YAML frontmatter keys into columns and exposes the prose as a `body` column, which turns a folder of notes into a queryable table.

**List every front-matter field of a local design note as a one-row table.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M2; features=decode,select
# md frontmatter keys become columns; body holds the prose

## Writes & effects

Reads describe the world; writes change it. qfs spells every mutation as a pipeline stage — `INSERT INTO`, `UPSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, `REMOVE` — or as a namespaced `CALL` for irreducible state transitions a driver declares (`mail.send`, `github.merge`, `slack.post`). The safety model is what makes this livable: describe is pure, preview touches nothing, `--commit` applies reversible writes, and anything irreversible (sending mail, merging a PR, deleting a blob) refuses to run without `--commit-irreversible`. The recipes below move from the safe and undoable (draft a mail, UPSERT a report) to the one-way doors (send, merge, dispatch CI), and most stay in today's frozen core grammar so they parse now even where the driver ships later.

**Draft a thank-you email to every customer who ordered this week (reversible — writing a draft sends nothing).**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M4; features=where,insert into,values,||
# A draft is reversible: it lands in /mail/drafts and auto-commits under policy.
/sql/pg/orders
|> where created_at >= '2026-06-19'
|> insert into /mail/drafts
     values (to => customer_email,
             subject => 'Thanks for order #' || order_id,
             body => 'Hi ' || customer_name || ', your order is on its way.')
```

**Send the queued win-back emails (irreversible — needs --commit-irreversible).**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M4; features=where,call,mail.send

## LET & the functional core

qfs gains a small functional core in M6: `LET` binds an intermediate relation or value so you can reference it more than once without recomputing or re-typing it; lambdas `(x: Type) => expr` are first-class values; and the higher-order builtins `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` take those lambdas to transform columns inline. A user-defined function is just a `LET`-bound lambda — there is no separate function namespace to learn. These features compose cleanly with everything from the earlier themes: a `LET` can hold a subquery you join back against, a lambda can normalize a key before a `GROUP BY`, and the whole thing can still end in a write. Anything that uses `LET` or a lambda arrow `=>` parses only on the extended grammar, so the blocks below are tagged accordingly; plain `map`/`filter`/`reduce` calls without a lambda stay core.

**Flag orders that beat the running average of their own product category.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=let,aggregate,group by,join,where
# Bind the per-category average once, then compare every order back against it.
let cat_avg =
  /sql/pg/orders
  |> aggregate avg(amount) as avg_amount group by category
/sql/pg/orders as o
|> join cat_avg as c on o.category == c.category
|> where o.amount > c.avg_amount
|> select o.id, o.category, o.amount, c.avg_amount
```

**Rank each rep against their team's own average deal size.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=let,aggregate,group by,join,extend
let team_avg =
  /sql/pg/deals
  |> aggregate avg(value) as team_avg_value group by team
/sql/pg/deals as d
|> join team_avg as t on d.team == t.team
|> extend vs_team = d.value - t.team_avg_value
|> select d.rep, d.team, d.value, vs_team
|> order by vs_team
```

**Reuse one active-customer set for both a count and a revenue total.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=let,where,join,aggregate
# active is referenced twice: once to scope orders, once to count the cohort.
let active =
  /sql/pg/customers
  |> where status == 'active'
/sql/pg/orders as o
|> join active as a on o.customer_id == a.id
|> aggregate count(active.id) as active_customers, sum(o.amount) as active_revenue
```

```

**Define a reusable margin function once and apply it across products.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=let,=>,extend,order by

let margin = (price: Float, cost: Float) => (price - cost) / price

|> extend gross_margin = margin(unit_price, unit_cost)
|> where gross_margin < 0.2
|> order by gross_margin
```

**Split a comma-separated tags column into a normalized list per row.**

/sql/pg/articles
|> extend tags = map(split(raw_tags, ','), clean)
|> select id, title, tags
```

**Keep only the high-value line items inside each invoice.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M6; features==>,filter,extend
/sql/pg/invoices
|> extend big_lines = filter(line_items, (li: Row) => li.amount > 1000)
|> where size(big_lines) > 0
|> select id, customer, big_lines
```

**Total each order's line items with a reduce.**

```qfs

|> where created_at >= cutoff
|> extend is_fresh = created_at >= cutoff
|> select id, created_at, is_fresh
```

|> join org_avg on true
|> where merged_count > org_avg_merged
```

**Score Slack messages with a reusable urgency lambda.**

# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=let,aggregate,group by,join,where
let cohort =
  /sql/pg/accounts
  |> aggregate avg(annual_spend) as cohort_avg group by plan
/sql/pg/accounts as a

```

**Apply a tax lambda per jurisdiction and reduce to a grand invoice total.**

let taxed = (li: Row) => li.amount * (1 + li.tax_rate)
/sql/pg/invoices
|> extend total_with_tax = reduce(map(line_items, taxed), (acc: Float, x: Float) => acc + x, 0.0)
|> select id, customer, total_with_tax
```

## Transactions

A `TRANSACTION { … }` block commits a set of writes all-or-nothing across heterogeneous sources — a SQL row, a local ledger line, an object in S3, a git commit — so that either every write lands or none does. The block is **reversible-only**: every effect inside must be undoable (UPSERT, INSERT of a draft, a git commit), so the engine can roll the whole set back if any participant fails. An irreversible effect — `CALL mail.send`, `CALL github.merge`, a destructive `REMOVE` against an append-only log — **inside** a `TRANSACTION` is a parse-time error, not a runtime one: the grammar refuses it before any work begins. The pattern is therefore always two recipes — first the transaction reaches its commit point, then a *separate* block performs the irreversible side effect once the durable state is safely on disk.

Each `TRANSACTION { … }` is a single statement (`grammar=extended`, delivered in M6). The separate irreversible follow-up is frequently `grammar=core`, since `CALL` and ordinary effects are frozen grammar.

**Record a paid invoice in both the SQL ledger and the local audit ledger atomically.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,upsert into,values
# Both rows land or neither does — the local ledger never drifts from the database of record.
transaction {
  upsert into /sql/pg/invoices
    values (id => 'INV-4821', status => 'paid', paid_at => '2026-06-26')
  upsert into /local/ledger/2026-06.jsonl
    values (invoice => 'INV-4821', event => 'paid', amount => 1290.00)
}
```

**Promote a build artifact to the release bucket and stamp its release row together.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,upsert into,select,decode
# The S3 object and the releases table move as one unit.
transaction {
  upsert into /s3/releases/app-1.4.0.tar.gz
    /s3/ci-staging/app-1.4.0.tar.gz
  upsert into /sql/pg/releases
    values (version => '1.4.0', channel => 'stable', published_at => '2026-06-26')
}
```

**Onboard a new customer: write the SQL customer row and seed their drive folder index.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,upsert into,values,encode
# A half-created customer (row but no workspace, or workspace but no row) is impossible.
transaction {
  upsert into /sql/pg/customers
    values (id => 'C-9001', name => 'Northwind Traders', tier => 'pro')
  upsert into /drive/Customers/C-9001/manifest.json
    values (customer => 'C-9001', created => '2026-06-26', tier => 'pro')
}
```

**Apply a config change as a git commit and flip the deployment-state row in lockstep.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,insert into,upsert into,values

transaction {
  insert into /git/infra/commits
    values (branch => 'main',
            message => 'bump replicas to 6',
            path => 'k8s/web.yaml',
            content => 'replicas: 6')
  upsert into /sql/pg/deploy_state
    values (service => 'web', desired_replicas => 6, updated_at => '2026-06-26')
}
```

**Move money between two SQL accounts so the debit and credit are inseparable.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,update,set,where
# Classic double-entry: a failure after the debit must not leave the credit unbooked.
transaction {
  update /sql/pg/accounts
    set balance = balance - 500
    where id == 'ACC-100'
  update /sql/pg/accounts
    set balance = balance + 500
    where id == 'ACC-200'
}
```

**Reconcile an order across SQL, the S3 receipt blob, and the local fulfilment ledger.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,upsert into,values,encode
# Three sources, one atomic boundary: order state, durable receipt, and ledger line.
transaction {
  upsert into /sql/pg/orders
    values (id => 'O-7700', status => 'fulfilled', fulfilled_at => '2026-06-26')
  upsert into /s3/receipts/O-7700.json
    values (order => 'O-7700', total => 240.00, currency => 'USD')
  upsert into /local/ledger/fulfilment.jsonl
    values (order => 'O-7700', event => 'shipped')
}
```

**Use a LET-bound batch id to tag a SQL write and a Cloudflare KV write identically.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=let,transaction,upsert into,values
# One generated id threads through every participant so cross-store joins stay sound.
let batch = 'B-2026-06-26-01'
transaction {
  upsert into /sql/pg/import_batches
    values (id => batch, state => 'committed', rows => 4200)
  upsert into /kv/imports/last_batch
    values (value => batch)

transaction {
  insert into /git/pricing/commits
    values (branch => 'main',
            message => 'pricing snapshot 2026-06-26',
            path => 'prices.csv',

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,update,set,where,upsert into,values
# Either the account is locked AND the case is documented, or nothing changes.
transaction {
  update /sql/pg/users
    set status = 'suspended', suspended_at = '2026-06-26'
    where id == 'U-553'
  upsert into /drive/Trust/cases/U-553.json
    values (user => 'U-553', reason => 'fraud_signal', opened => '2026-06-26')
}
```

**Close a sprint: archive the board state to git and roll the SQL sprint counter forward.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,insert into,update,set,where

}
```

**Sync a derived report to both R2 and the SQL report index in one commit.**

transaction {
  upsert into /r2/reports/q2-summary.csv
    /sql/pg/sales

  upsert into /sql/pg/reports
    values (name => 'q2-summary', location => 'r2://reports/q2-summary.csv', built_at => '2026-06-26')
}
```

**Transfer inventory between warehouses with two UPDATEs that must agree.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,update,set,where
# Stock leaves one location only if it arrives at the other.
transaction {
  update /sql/pg/inventory
    set qty = qty - 30
    where sku == 'SKU-12' AND warehouse == 'WH-EAST'

    set qty = qty + 30
    where sku == 'SKU-12' AND warehouse == 'WH-WEST'

    values (slug => 'refund-policy', title => 'Refund policy', published => '2026-06-26')
}
```

**Bind three batch rows with a LET value and commit SQL, drive, and KV as a unit.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=let,transaction,upsert into,values
# A single run id stamps all three stores so the import is traceable end to end.
let run = 'RUN-558'

  update /sql/pg/releases
    set tagged = true, tag = 'v1.4.0'
    where version == '1.4.0'
}
```

**Migrate a row between tables: insert into the new table and tombstone the old one atomically.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,insert into,where,update,set
# The new home and the old tombstone commit together — no orphan, no double-live row.
transaction {
  insert into /sql/pg/accounts_v2
    /sql/pg/accounts

transaction {
  insert into /git/data-fixes/commits
    values (branch => 'main',
            message => 'fix: country code for C-44',

            content => '{"id":"C-44","country":"JP"}')
  update /sql/pg/customers
    set country = 'JP'
    where id == 'C-44'
}
```

**Provision a project: SQL project row, drive workspace manifest, and D1 metadata, all-or-nothing.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,upsert into,values
# Three independent stores either all reflect the new project or none do.
transaction {
  upsert into /sql/pg/projects
    values (id => 'PRJ-9', name => 'Atlas', status => 'active')
  upsert into /drive/Projects/Atlas/manifest.json
    values (project => 'PRJ-9', created => '2026-06-26')
  upsert into /d1/edge/projects
    values (id => 'PRJ-9', region => 'apac')
}
```

**Now the commit-point pattern: settle an invoice atomically, THEN email the receipt in a separate block.**

The transaction below moves only reversible state — the SQL invoice row and the local ledger line. The receipt email is irreversible (`CALL mail.send` cannot be un-sent), so it lives in its own block that runs *after* the transaction has committed. Putting that `CALL` inside the `TRANSACTION` would be a parse-time error.

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,upsert into,values
# Step 1 of 2 — durable, reversible settlement reaches its commit point first.
transaction {
  upsert into /sql/pg/invoices
    values (id => 'INV-4821', status => 'paid', paid_at => '2026-06-26')
  upsert into /local/ledger/2026-06.jsonl
    values (invoice => 'INV-4821', event => 'paid', amount => 1290.00)
}
```

**Send the receipt only after settlement committed (separate, irreversible — runs with --commit-irreversible).**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=where,call,||
# Step 2 of 2 — the irreversible call lives OUTSIDE the transaction, after the commit point.
/sql/pg/invoices
|> where id == 'INV-4821' AND status == 'paid'
|> call mail.send(to => billing_email,
                  subject => 'Receipt for ' || id,
                  body => 'Thank you — invoice ' || id || ' is paid in full.')
```

**Commit-point pattern (PR merge): record the merge decision in SQL atomically with a git audit commit.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,upsert into,insert into,values
# Step 1 of 2 — reversible bookkeeping for the merge decision commits first.
transaction {
  upsert into /sql/pg/pr_decisions
    values (pr => 42, repo => 'acme/web', decision => 'approved', at => '2026-06-26')
  insert into /git/audit/commits
    values (branch => 'main',
            message => 'approve merge of PR #42',
            path => 'decisions/pr-42.json',
            content => '{"pr":42,"decision":"approved"}')
}
```

**Perform the actual merge only after the decision committed (separate, irreversible github.merge).**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M6; features=where,call
# Step 2 of 2 — github.merge is irreversible, so it runs OUTSIDE the transaction afterwards.
/github/acme/web/pulls/42
|> where state == 'open'
|> call github.merge(number => 42, method => 'squash')
```

**Commit-point pattern (announcement): stage the release state atomically, THEN post to Slack separately.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=transaction,upsert into,values
# Step 1 of 2 — the durable release state (SQL row + S3 notes blob) commits as a unit.
transaction {
  upsert into /sql/pg/releases
    values (version => '1.4.0', channel => 'stable', announced => false)
  upsert into /s3/releases/notes-1.4.0.md
    values (version => '1.4.0', notes => '# 1.4.0\n- faster sync\n- bug fixes')
}
```

**Announce the release only after state committed (separate, irreversible slack.post).**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M6; features=where,call,||
# Step 2 of 2 — slack.post cannot be un-posted, so it runs OUTSIDE the transaction.
/sql/pg/releases
|> where version == '1.4.0' AND announced == false
|> call slack.post(channel => '#releases',
                   text => 'Shipped ' || version || ' to the stable channel.')
```

## Policy, ACL & directory

Access in qfs is itself a query. `CREATE POLICY <name> ALLOW <verbs> ON '<glob>' [WHERE <cond>]` writes a row into the policy registry, and because the registry is just another mount you read, audit, and reshape policy the same way you read any service. Policies grant verbs (`read`, `write`, `call`, …) over a path glob to a role or group, with `WHERE` clauses that scope down to rows and columns and can defer the decision to your real identity provider via `member_of('/directories/...')`. The companion `/directories/{google,entra,ad}` mounts expose groups and users read-only, so a single source of truth — Google Workspace, Entra, or Active Directory — drives both who-is-who lookups and who-can-do-what grants. Most of these are `grammar=core` (POLICY is a frozen DDL keyword and `member_of(...)` is an ordinary function call); only the few that bind with `LET` or pass a lambda `=>` are `grammar=extended`.

## Server automation

When qfs runs as a server it stops being a one-shot CLI and becomes a small standing
runtime: queries you would otherwise type by hand are registered once as **endpoints,
triggers, jobs, views, and webhooks**, then fire on HTTP requests, upstream events, or
an external schedule. Each is a single DDL statement that is sugar over a write into `/server/...`,
so the whole automation surface is itself queryable and version-controlled. qfs is not a
scheduler — it owns no clock or dispatcher. A JOB is a **saved named plan** whose cadence is
fired by **OS cron (individual) or Cloudflare Cron Triggers (managed)** — qfs does not run it.
Triggers reference the firing row as `NEW.*`; `LAST_RUN()` exposes the timestamp of the
previous external run as metadata, so a plan reads only what changed since. Reversible plans
(drafts, UPSERTs to storage, view materialization) run unattended; irreversible `CALL`s in a
plan still require the server's configured irreversible-commit policy.

**Expose the current on-call engineer as a read-only HTTP endpoint.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M8; features=create endpoint,where,order by,limit,select
# GET /oncall returns the single active rotation row as JSON
create endpoint GET /oncall as
  /sql/pg/oncall_rotations
  |> where active == true
  |> order by shift_start DESC
  |> limit 1
  |> select engineer, phone, slack_handle, shift_end
```

**Serve a per-customer order history endpoint keyed by a path parameter.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M8; features=create endpoint,where,join,order by,select
# GET /customers/:id/orders joins orders to line items for the requested customer
create endpoint GET /customers/:id/orders as
  /sql/pg/orders
  |> where customer_id == :id
  |> join /sql/pg/line_items on line_items.order_id == orders.id
  |> order by orders.placed_at DESC
  |> select orders.id, orders.placed_at, line_items.sku, line_items.qty, line_items.price
```

**Accept new leads over HTTP and write them straight into Postgres.**

```qfs

create endpoint GET /metrics/daily as
  /sql/pg/orders

## The /sys admin surface

Administering qfs is not a separate console — it is the same query language pointed at `/sys`.
Users, accounts, policies, connections, audit, projects, approvals, metrics, and billing are all
just paths, so you grant a role with `INSERT`, revoke with `REMOVE`, inspect who did what with a
`/sys/audit |> WHERE …`, and observe load with `/sys/metrics`. One safety invariant runs
through everything below: **`/sys/connections` describes connections by name and metadata only — it
never returns the secret, token, or password behind a connection.** You list, name, scope, and
revoke connections as data; you never read their credentials, because there is no column that holds
them. Listing/granting/revoking and audit reads land in M3 (the `/sys` driver); policies, projects,
and directory membership in M5; approvals, metrics, and billing in M9/M+.

**List every active human user and the role they currently hold.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M3; features=where,select,order by
/sys/users
|> where status == 'active' AND kind == 'human'
|> select email, display_name, role, last_seen_at
|> order by last_seen_at DESC
```

**Invite a new teammate as a read-only member.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M3; features=insert into,values,returning
insert into /sys/users
  values (email => 'dana@acme.com',
          display_name => 'Dana Reyes',
          role => 'viewer',
          status => 'invited')
|> returning email, role, status
```

**Promote a viewer to editor on their team.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M3; features=where,update,set,returning
/sys/users
|> where email == 'dana@acme.com' AND role == 'viewer'
|> update set role = 'editor'
|> returning email, role
```

**Off-board someone the moment they leave — revoke their account.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M3; features=where,remove
/sys/users
|> where email == 'former.staff@acme.com'
|> remove
```

**Find dormant accounts that have not signed in for 90 days.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M3; features=where,select,order by
/sys/users
|> where last_seen_at < '2026-03-28' AND status == 'active'
|> select email, display_name, role, last_seen_at
|> order by last_seen_at
```

**Audit which accounts still hold admin and were granted it by whom.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M3; features=where,select
/sys/accounts
|> where role == 'admin'
|> select email, granted_by, granted_at, scope
```

**Grant a service account scoped to a single project.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M3; features=insert into,values,returning
insert into /sys/accounts
  values (kind => 'service',
          name => 'ci-bot',
          role => 'editor',
          scope => 'project:web-frontend')
|> returning name, role, scope
```

**List the policies governing a sensitive SQL table.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M5; features=where,select,order by
/sys/policies
|> where resource LIKE '/sql/pg/payroll%'
|> select name, principal, effect, columns, row_filter
|> order by name
```

**Attach a row+column policy that masks PII for the support role.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M5; features=insert into,values
# Support sees the customer table but only their own region's rows, no SSN column.
insert into /sys/policies
  values (name => 'support-customers-eu',
          principal => 'role:support',
          resource => '/sql/pg/customers',
          effect => 'allow',
          columns => 'id,name,email,region',
          row_filter => "region = 'EU'")
```

**Revoke a policy that has become too permissive.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M5; features=where,remove
/sys/policies
|> where name == 'legacy-allow-all-finance'
|> remove
```

**Inspect every connection by name and metadata — no secrets are ever returned.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M3; features=select,order by
# /sys/connections has no credential column; you see scope and status, never the token.
/sys/connections
|> select name, driver, scope, status, created_by, last_used_at
|> order by driver, name
```

**Find connections that have gone stale and were never used.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M3; features=where,select,order by
/sys/connections
|> where last_used_at IS NULL OR last_used_at < '2026-01-01'
|> select name, driver, created_by, created_at, last_used_at
|> order by created_at
```

**Register a new connection by reference — credentials are supplied out of band, not in the query.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M3; features=insert into,values,returning
# The row records the connection's identity and scope; the secret lives in the vault, not here.
insert into /sys/connections
  values (name => 'acme-pg-readonly',
          driver => 'sql/pg',
          scope => 'project:analytics',
          secret_ref => 'vault://acme/pg-readonly')
|> returning name, driver, scope, status
```

**Disconnect a third-party integration cleanly.**

## AI over MCP

When qfs is mounted as an MCP server, an AI agent stops calling a dozen bespoke service APIs and instead speaks one language: it turns a teammate's plain-English ask into a single qfs statement, then runs it through the describe→preview→commit loop. **describe** tells the model what a path is and which columns exist; **preview** dry-runs the statement and reports its effect class — a read returns "reads only, 0 effects" and is safe to show immediately, a reversible write reports the draft or UPSERT it would make, and an irreversible step reports that it would send mail or merge a PR. The agent's job is text-to-SQL on the client side; qfs's job is to make the consequence of each statement legible before anything happens. Under the **default safety mode** reversible writes auto-commit within `POLICY` while irreversible `CALL`s wait for a human to approve, but the mode is selectable — a read-only "explore" mode refuses every effect, a "draft" mode lets reversible writes through, and a supervised "auto" mode can be granted narrow irreversible scopes — so the same generated statement is gated differently depending on how much the operator has delegated. Every recipe below is one statement the agent emitted in response to the natural-language title; the prose around the loop is the model's, the qfs is the contract.

**"What inboxes and databases am I even connected to?"**

## Agent fabric & cloud team

Once your machines join the qfs Cloud fabric, every host's running Claude Code sessions become just
another mounted, queryable surface at `/hosts/<host>/claude/sessions` — you read what each agent is doing,
steer it by writing instructions, and fan work across a whole pool of hosts from one prompt. The
team layer adds shared connections at the project level and cross-machine federation, so a
coordinator can JOIN results from agents living on different machines into a single mesh. The tunnel
that carries these calls requires a qfs Cloud sign-in, and every cross-machine read or write is
bounded by POLICY — a host only answers for the rows and paths your role is allowed to reach.

**See which agents on the build box are still grinding and where they are.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M7; features=where,select,order by
# Live status of every running Claude Code session on one host.
/hosts/buildbox-01/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'running'
|> select task, progress, last_message, started_at
|> order by progress
```

**Find sessions that have stalled — running but silent for a while.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M7; features=where,select,order by,AND
/hosts/buildbox-01/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'running' AND last_message_at < '2026-06-26T09:00:00Z'
|> select id, task, last_message, last_message_at
|> order by last_message_at
```

**Steer one agent: nudge the current session to write tests before it ships.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M7; features=insert into,values
# A reversible write into the session's instruction channel; POLICY bounds who may steer this host.
insert into /hosts/buildbox-01/claude/sessions/current/instructions
  values ('Add unit tests for the new parser before opening the PR, then run cargo test --workspace.')
```

**Redirect a specific stuck session to a smaller, safer scope.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M7; features=insert into,values
insert into /hosts/buildbox-01/claude/sessions/sess_9f2a/instructions
  values ('Stop the refactor. Just fix the failing test in tokenizer.rs and report back.')
```

**Pull the last thing every agent said across one host, newest first.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M7; features=select,order by,limit
/hosts/buildbox-01/claude/sessions
|> select host, id, task, status, last_message
|> order by last_message_at
|> limit 50
```

**Count how each host's agents are spread across statuses.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M7; features=aggregate,group by
/hosts/buildbox-01/claude/sessions
|> aggregate count() as sessions, max(progress) as furthest group by status
```

**Fan one read across the whole pool: every running agent on every host.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=where,select,order by
# A wildcard host segment fans the read across the federated fabric; policy scopes each host's rows.
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'running'
|> select host, task, progress, last_message
|> order by host, progress
```

**Mesh roll-up: how many agents are busy on each machine right now.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M+; features=where,aggregate,group by,order by
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'running'
|> aggregate count() as busy, min(progress) as least_done group by host
|> order by busy
```

**Broadcast a steer: tell every idle agent across the fleet to pick up the queue.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M+; features=where,insert into,values
# One pipeline writes an instruction into each matched session; the tunnel needs a Cloud sign-in.
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'idle'
|> insert into /hosts/*/claude/sessions/instructions
     values (host => host, session => id,
             text => 'Claim the next ticket from /sys/projects/qfs/queue and start it.')
```

**Coordinator: collect finished agents' results from several hosts into one list.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=where,select,order by
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'done'
|> select host, task, result, finished_at
|> order by finished_at
```

**Merge agent state with the tickets they were assigned (cross-surface JOIN).**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=join,on,where,select
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> join /sql/pg/agent_tasks on sessions.task_id == agent_tasks.id
|> where sessions.status == 'running'
|> select host, agent_tasks.title, agent_tasks.priority, sessions.progress
```

**Cross-machine federation read: list source files an agent on another host is touching.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=where,select,order by
# /git on a remote host resolves over the tunnel; every blob read is policy-bounded.
/hosts/gpu-rig-02/claude/sessions/current/changed_files
|> where staged == true
|> select path, additions, deletions
|> order by additions
```

**Pool the team's open PRs that agents authored across all hosts.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=where,join,on,select
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'done'
|> join /github/acme/web/pulls on sessions.pr_number == pulls.number
|> select host, pulls.number, pulls.title, pulls.state
```

**Stand up a team-wide connection at the project level so every host shares it.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M9; features=insert into,values
# A project connection is visible to all hosts in the team, gated by policy.
insert into /sys/projects/qfs/connections
  values (name => 'pg-prod', driver => 'sql/pg',
          dsn => 'postgres://reader@db.acme.internal/app', scope => 'team')
```

**Promote one engineer's personal connection to a shared team connection.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M9; features=where,insert into,values
/sys/connections
|> where name == 'slack-eng' AND owner == 'a@qmu.jp'
|> insert into /sys/projects/qfs/connections
     values (name => name, driver => driver, scope => 'team')
```

**Audit which team connections every host can currently reach.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M9; features=where,select,order by
/sys/projects/qfs/connections
|> where scope == 'team'
|> select name, driver, owner, last_used_at
|> order by last_used_at
```

**Check which hosts have actually joined the fabric and when they last reported.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=where,select,order by
/sys/projects/qfs/hosts
|> where online == true
|> select host, agent_count, last_heartbeat_at, cloud_signed_in
|> order by last_heartbeat_at
```

**Reusable filter: define "busy host" once, then count and rank with it (functional core).**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M+; features=let,=>,filter,aggregate,group by
let is_busy = (s: Session) => s.status = 'running' AND s.progress < 0.9
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where filter(self, is_busy)
|> aggregate count() as still_busy group by host
```

**Bind the running fleet once, then both summarize it and pick the laggards.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=let,where,join,on,select
let running = (/hosts/*/claude/sessions |> where status == 'running')
running
|> join /sys/projects/qfs/hosts on running.host == hosts.host
|> where hosts.cloud_signed_in == true
|> select running.host, running.task, running.progress, hosts.region
```

**Coordinator fan-out: queue one task per online host as a steerable instruction.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M+; features=where,insert into,values,||
/sys/projects/qfs/hosts
|> where online == true
|> insert into /hosts/*/claude/sessions/instructions
     values (host => host, session => 'next',
             text => 'You are shard ' || host || '. Build and test only crates owned by this host.')
```

**Reduce many agents' progress into a single fleet completion figure.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M+; features=let,reduce,=>,where,select
let avg_progress = (rows: Relation) =>
  reduce(rows.progress, (acc: Float, p: Float) => acc + p, 0.0) / count(rows)
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'running'
|> select avg_progress(self) as fleet_progress
```

**Spot conflicts: two agents editing the same file on different hosts.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M+; features=join,on,where,select,distinct
/hosts/*/claude/sessions/current/changed_files as a
|> join /hosts/*/claude/sessions/current/changed_files as b on a.path == b.path
|> where a.host <> b.host
|> select distinct a.path, a.host, b.host
```

**Collect every agent's final result and drop it into a shared report blob.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=where,select,encode,upsert into
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'done'
|> select host, task, result, finished_at
|> encode md
|> upsert into /drive/Team/agent-run-2026-06-26.md
```

**Post a mesh standup to Slack: who finished what, grouped by host.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M+; features=where,aggregate,group by,insert into,values,||
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'done'
|> aggregate count() as shipped group by host
|> insert into /slack/acme/eng-fabric/messages
     values (text => host || ' shipped ' || shipped || ' tasks this run.')
```

**Halt the fleet on red: tell every running agent to pause when CI is failing.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=extended; milestone=M+; features=where,insert into,values
/hosts/*/claude/sessions
|> where status == 'running'
|> insert into /hosts/*/claude/sessions/instructions
     values (host => host, session => id,
             text => 'CI on main is red. Stop pushing and wait for the all-clear.')
```

**Reconcile the mesh against policy: which sessions a remote host refused to expose.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=where,select,order by
# Cross-machine reads are policy-bounded; the audit log records what each host withheld.
/sys/audit
|> where action == 'fabric.read' AND outcome == 'denied'
|> select host, principal, path, reason, at
|> order by at
```

**Cross-machine federation: JOIN one agent's commits with the team's PR review state.**

```qfs
# qfs-cookbook: grammar=core; milestone=M+; features=join,on,where,select,order by
/hosts/gpu-rig-02/claude/sessions/current/commits
