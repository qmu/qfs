//! `qfs-cmd` — the command layer (RFD-0001 §7).
//!
//! Parses argv with clap-derive and dispatches one of three arms into the shared
//! [`qfs_core`] engine:
//! - **interactive shell** (no subcommand) — the FTP-like prompt (RFD §7);
//! - `qfs run '<stmt>'` / `-e` — one-shot statement execution (RFD §7);
//! - `qfs serve <config.qfs>` — boot the server (RFD §8).
//!
//! Every arm returns a structured [`qfs_core::CfsError::NotImplemented`] at E0 (no
//! panics, no `unwrap`/`expect`). This crate holds **no domain logic** (fidelity
//! guard G5): it depends on `qfs-core` and `qfs-server` only and never reaches past
//! `qfs-core` into `qfs-lang` / `qfs-plan` / `qfs-driver` / `qfs-codec` /
//! `qfs-parser` (acceptance criterion C4, enforced by `tests/dep_direction.rs`).
//!
//! Structured `tracing` is initialised once here, at the command boundary only.
