//! the server resolve through.
//!
//! Each registry is generic over a **trait object** (`Arc<dyn Driver>` /
//! `Arc<dyn Codec>` / an owned `ProcSig`), not over concrete types
//! (fidelity guard G2): a new driver (E4) implements the trait and calls `register`
//! — it touches zero core types. All three share the identical `new` / `register` /
//! `resolve` shape and use `BTreeMap` for deterministic iteration (test stability).
//! Empty at E0; the unit tests prove empty / round-trip / duplicate / absent.
