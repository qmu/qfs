//! The irreversible-effect commit gate (t37, blueprint §7/§8).
//!
//! `qfs` runs cross-service effect-plans **unattended** — a large blast radius. Some effects
//! are *irreversible*: a `REMOVE` (delete) or a `CALL mail.send` cannot be undone (the
//! `irreversible` bit is set by the planner per proc/verb and surfaced on
//! [`Plan::is_irreversible`]). This module is the single, pure gate that decides whether a
//! plan carrying an irreversible effect may proceed to `COMMIT`, given **how** qfs is being
//! driven ([`RunMode`]).
//!
//! ## Why it lives in `qfs-core` (the hub)
//! Both faces of the binary commit through `qfs-core`'s [`Plan`]: the CLI one-shot
//! (`qfs run … --commit`, via `qfs-exec`) and the serve fire paths (HTTP / cron / watchtower
//! committers, via `qfs-server`). Placing the guard on the hub's `Plan` lets *both* reuse one
//! pure decision rather than each re-deriving "is this safe to apply unattended?". It is pure
//! data-in/data-out (no I/O, no prompting) so it stays wasm-clean and testable with no creds.
//!
//! ## The decision (fail closed)
//! - **Reversible plan** ⇒ always `Ok` (this gate only governs irreversible effects).
//! - **Irreversible plan**:
//!   - [`RunMode::Ci`] / [`RunMode::Server`] (non-interactive): **hard-fail closed** unless the
//!     operator passed an explicit `--commit-irreversible` ack ([`Ack::Granted`]). No prompt is
//!     possible with no human present, so the safe default is refusal.
//!   - [`RunMode::Cli`] (interactive): the caller must PREVIEW and then prompt the human; this
//!     gate returns [`NeedsPreview::Prompt`] so the CLI knows to confirm after the PREVIEW.
//!   - [`RunMode::CliOneShot`]: a non-interactive one-shot invocation — treated like CI: an
//!     explicit ack is required (a one-shot has no TTY to confirm on).
//!
//! The redaction control (`Secret`), the policy default-deny (t35), and the audit ledger (t36)
//! are the *other* legs of the defense-in-depth; this is the irreversible-effect leg.
