//! The **higher-order** built-ins `map` / `filter` / `reduce` (blueprint §3, M6 ticket t61).
//!
//! These are the entries that make the closed core's "functions are values" promise
//! (decision H) concrete: each takes a **function-typed** argument — a lambda
//! ([`qfs_parser::Expr::Lambda`]) — alongside a collection, and transforms the collection by
//! applying that lambda. Registering them here, in the open [`StdlibRegistry`], is the whole
//! point: a powerful new capability (inline transformation that today needs an external
//! script) is added with **zero** new keywords — they are ordinary registry functions, not
//! grammar.
//!
//! Unlike a scalar built-in, a higher-order built-in cannot be a `Value → Value`
//! [`BuiltinEval::Scalar`] (a lambda is not a [`Value`]). So they register as
//! [`BuiltinEval::HigherOrder`] markers carrying a [`HigherOrderKind`]: this module supplies
//! their **signatures** (arity + return type) for the typing pass / the function registry,
//! while the actual closure-application semantics live in the pure lambda evaluator
//! ([`crate::lambda`]), which dispatches on the kind. Everything stays pure — values in,
//! values out, no I/O (blueprint §3 purity), so a `map`/`filter`/`reduce` over a relation never
//! constructs an effect node and the safety floor is untouched.
