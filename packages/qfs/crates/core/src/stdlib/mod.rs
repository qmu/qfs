//! The qfs **standard library** of built-in pure functions + the **driver-prelude
//! registration mechanism** (blueprint §3, ticket t08).
//!
//! This module *populates* the second open registry — functions + procedures — that
//! t06's name resolution *resolves against*. It realises two blueprint §3 rules:
//!
//! 1. **Closed core + open function registry.** The stdlib is a small, stable
//!    vocabulary (`UPPER`/`SUBSTR`/`DATE_ADD`/`COALESCE`/`COUNT`/…) registered in the
//!    [`StdlibRegistry`]; a `fn(...)` in an expression resolves against it, adding
//!    **zero** keywords to the frozen core.
//! 2. **Aliases are pure functions, never keywords.** A driver contributes
//!    receiver-typed pure aliases (`SEND`, `MERGE`) through its
//!    [`prelude()`](qfs_driver::Driver::prelude); the [`StdlibRegistry`] merges them
//!    **namespaced by `DriverId`** (never flattened into the core namespace) so t06's
//!    receiver-typed resolution keeps them collision-proof and scoped.
//!
//! ## Purity invariant (the safety property, blueprint §3)
//! Every built-in is **pure**: a scalar/aggregate fn maps `Value → Value` with **no
//! I/O**; the effectful-*shaped* ones (`READ`, `http.get`) construct a deferred
//! plan/source [`PlanNode`] and **never** perform the read here. The whole module is
//! data-in / data-out — no network, no filesystem, no wall clock (`NOW`/`CURRENT_DATE`
//! read a *frozen* [`EvalCtx`], making PREVIEW reproducible). This is what keeps every
//! plan dry-runnable and golden-testable without credentials.
//!
//! ## Capability gating (least-privilege, blueprint §8)
//! `env()`, `READ`, and `http.get` reach outside the pure data plane. They are gated
//! behind the [`EvalCtx::capabilities`] flag (default **off**) so an unattended /
//! pure-eval context denies them; secret values an `env()` returns never appear in an
//! error string (the structured errors carry only the *name* requested).
