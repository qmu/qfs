//! The [`StdlibRegistry`] — populates the function registry with the core stdlib and
//! merges driver **preludes** (RFD-0001 §3/§5, ticket t08).
//!
//! This is the registry t06's name resolution resolves `fn(...)` against (the second open
//! registry). It holds the core built-ins (scalar/aggregate/table-valued) and, for each
//! driver, the receiver-typed prelude aliases the driver ships — **namespaced by
//! [`DriverId`]**, never flattened into the core namespace, so receiver-typed resolution
//! stays collision-proof (the same alias on two drivers is fine; a duplicate *within* one
//! prelude is a [`PreludeError::Duplicate`]).
//!
//! ## Purity invariant at registration (RFD §3)
//! A prelude's alias body is qfs source (`d |> CALL mail.send`). [`StdlibRegistry::
//! register_prelude`] parses each body and asserts it is **plan-constructing** (a single
//! `CALL` desugaring) — a body that is not yields [`PreludeError::Impure`], so a prelude
//! can never smuggle an impure or non-`-> Plan` alias into scope. The resulting
//! [`ResolvedAlias`] is exactly the `AliasFn` shape t06 already resolves against.
