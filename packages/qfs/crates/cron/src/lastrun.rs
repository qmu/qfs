//! `LAST_RUN()` — the durable-state registry binding, **scoped to JOB query evaluation only**
//! (RFD §8). The stateful-watcher concern: a JOB's `DO` body can run an *incremental* query
//! (e.g. "messages since last run") by referencing `LAST_RUN()`, which resolves to the JOB's
//! stored high-water boundary.
//!
//! ## Implemented as an injection-safe AST rewrite (the t32 `bind_params` twin)
//! At dispatch the scheduler walks the rehydrated DO body and replaces every nullary
//! `LAST_RUN()` call ([`Expr::Fn`] named `LAST_RUN` with no args) with a single typed literal —
//! the boundary as `Expr::Lit(Literal::Int(<epoch-seconds>))`. Because the body is the
//! pre-parsed t31 spec (never re-parsed) and the boundary becomes ONE literal leaf, there is zero
//! parse-time injection surface and the rewrite is structurally identical for any boundary value.
//!
//! `LAST_RUN()` is **never** registered into the global stdlib namespace — the substitution runs
//! ONLY here, on the JOB's DO body at dispatch, so the binding is scoped to JOB evaluation by
//! construction (it cannot leak into arbitrary statements). On first run (`last_run_at = None`)
//! the boundary is the sentinel epoch `0`.
