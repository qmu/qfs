//! The **injected** session-source seam (the vendor-free analogue of `qfs-driver-sys`'s
//! `SysBackend`). The introspective driver half is pure; the impure read/append half — reading
//! Claude Code's on-disk session state and appending a steering instruction — is provided by the
//! `qfs` binary leaf through this trait, so this crate stays tokio-free and I/O-free (the
//! dep-direction guard: only the terminal binary opens a real path; the crate is wasm-buildable
//! and the purity proof stays green).
//!
//! No vendor type and no filesystem path crosses this boundary — only owned qfs DTOs (`RowBatch`,
//! a session-id `&str`, and the structured [`ClaudeError`]). The exact session-state format
//! (Claude Code's on-disk layout vs. a local IPC/API) and how the "current" session is identified
//! are the implementor's concern (the open product decision flagged in the ticket); this seam
//! names none of it.
//!
//! ## This seam calls no model (blueprint §15, decision W supersedes decision K)
//! Nothing here calls or hosts an LLM. `scan_sessions` reads metadata an agent runtime already
//! wrote; `append_instruction` hands the agent a steering message. The model runs elsewhere. (qfs
//! DOES call a model via `|> transform` — §15 / decision W — through `qfs-driver-transform`'s
//! injected provider, never this façade seam.)
