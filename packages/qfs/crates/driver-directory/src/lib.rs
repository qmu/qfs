//! `qfs-driver-directory` — the **identity-directory driver** (blueprint §6; roadmap §1.2
//! decision I / M5, t58).
//!
//! "Everything is a path" extends to who you are: [`DirectoryDriver`] exposes an external identity
//! directory — LDAP / Active Directory / Entra ID / Google Workspace — as ordinary qfs relations
//! under `/directories/<provider>/...`:
//!
//! - `/directories/<provider>/groups` — the directory's groups/teams,
//! - `/directories/<provider>/users` — its user identities (metadata only),
//! - `/directories/<provider>/memberships` — the flat `(user, group)` join.
//!
//! so the t57 `member_of('/directories/<provider>/groups/<g>')` policy predicate resolves against a
//! **real directory** ("drive one [the policy] from the other [the directory]", decision I). This
//! driver supplies the data; t57 owns the predicate and keeps `evaluate` pure (membership resolved
//! into the [`DecisionContext`](../qfs_server) up front).
//!
//! ## The same split as the `/sys` self-config driver
//! [`DirectoryDriver`] is the analogue of `qfs-driver-sys`'s `SysDriver`: its **introspective**
//! half ([`Driver::describe`]/[`Driver::capabilities`]/[`Driver::pushdown`]) is **pure** — a stable,
//! credential-free schema (see [`directory_relation_schema`]) with NO directory connection and NO
//! secrets — and its `applier()` is a [`NoopApplier`]. READ-FIRST: there is no live write leg, so
//! this crate carries NO `qfs-runtime` dependency and stays wasm-buildable. The impure read source
//! (the live LDAP/AD/Entra/Workspace client) is INJECTED through the vendor-free [`DirectorySource`]
//! seam; a hermetic [`FixtureDirectory`] implements the same seam for tests + the in-memory case.
//!
//! ## Safety floor (read-first, roadmap §3.2)
//! - Describe is **pure and credential-free**; reads touch nothing mutable.
//! - Every relation declares ONLY `SELECT` — directory *writes* (provisioning / deprovisioning
//!   identities, a much larger blast radius) are **out of scope** here and are not even expressible
//!   through this driver (a future ticket with its own preview/commit/irreversible analysis).
//! - The schema has **no credential column**, so a bind secret cannot surface through a directory
//!   path even by accident.
