//! The **injected** directory-read seam (the vendor-free analogue of `qfs-driver-sql`'s
//! `SqlBackend` / `qfs-driver-sys`'s `SysBackend`). The introspective driver half is pure; the
//! impure read half — the live LDAP / AD / Entra / Google-Workspace client — is provided through
//! this trait, so this crate stays tokio-free, SDK-free, and wasm-buildable (only a leaf consumer
//! injects a networked client; the real connection is a DOCUMENTED SEAM, not a heavy SDK pulled
//! here).
//!
//! No vendor directory type crosses this boundary — only owned qfs DTOs (`RowBatch`, the
//! [`Provider`]/[`DirRelation`] tags, owned group-name `String`s, and the structured
//! [`DirectoryError`]).
//!
//! ## Authz is upstream of this data — beware the loop
//! A directory read that *feeds* a `member_of` policy decision must itself be safe to perform
//! **without that policy gating it** (else a cycle): membership is resolved through
//! [`resolve_is_member`] / [`DirectorySource::groups_of`] — a path that does **not** re-enter the
//! `member_of` evaluation. The binary calls this ONCE up front (t57 `resolve_memberships`) and
//! freezes the answer into the `DecisionContext`, keeping the policy `evaluate` pure.
