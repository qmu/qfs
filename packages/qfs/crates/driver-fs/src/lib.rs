//! `qfs-driver-fs` — the **first-class filesystem driver** (t68, blueprint §6): the real host
//! filesystem as a [`Archetype::BlobNamespace`] mounted at `/fs`, addressed under
//! operator-configured **named roots** rather than the fixed `/local` sandbox.
//!
//! ## Why `fs` exists beyond `/local`
//! `/local` (t28) is a sandboxed convenience over a single fixed root. `fs` addresses files on the
//! machine as ordinary paths under an operator-chosen **allowlist of roots**: a VFS path is
//! `/fs/<root>/<rel…>`, where `<root>` selects one configured base and `<rel…>` resolves under it.
//! That widens blast radius beyond a sandbox, so the security floor is the headline (t68): explicit
//! root scoping, hard rejection of `..`/absolute/symlink escapes **validated at BOTH scan and apply
//! time**, `POLICY` scopability per root (e.g. `ALLOW SELECT ON 'fs/projects/*'`), and `PREVIEW`
//! before commit. `REMOVE` deletes a real file and is **irreversible** (needs the extra ack); it is
//! never reclassified as reversible. The **default is deny-all** — with no root configured nothing
//! resolves (no implicit whole-disk access).
//!
//! ## Surface (templated structure-for-structure on `qfs-driver-local`)
//! - [`FsDriver`] — the introspective `Driver`: `mount()` = `/fs`, archetype
//!   [`Archetype::BlobNamespace`], the [`FsRow`] listing schema, capabilities
//!   `{ls,cp,mv,rm,upsert,remove}` (narrowed to `{ls}` on a `read_only` mount), pushdown
//!   `Partial{project}`, no procedures, no prelude. **Pure + cred-free + path-free**: the roots are
//!   injected from the binary, so the introspective half names no absolute host path and does no
//!   I/O (keeping it wasm-buildable and the purity proof green).
//! - [`FsApplier`] — the synchronous apply leg the contract hands back via `applier()` *and* the
//!   [`qfs_runtime::SharedApplier`] the runtime bridge drives.
//! - [`fs_apply_driver`] — wraps a [`FsDriver`]'s applier in a [`qfs_runtime::PlanApplierBridge`],
//!   ready to `register` into a `DriverRegistry` so a plan over `/fs` executes end-to-end.
//!
//! ## Confinement (blueprint §8)
//! Every path crosses [`fs_core::FsRoots::resolve`], which rejects unknown-root / `..` / symlink
//! escapes with [`FsError::UnknownRoot`]/[`FsError::OutsideRoot`] and performs no I/O on a rejected
//! path. The apply leg re-validates through the same resolve — defence in depth.
