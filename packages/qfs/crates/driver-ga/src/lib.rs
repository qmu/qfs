//! `qfs-driver-ga` — the **Google Analytics 4 read-only relational `Driver`** (RFD-0001 §5, E4
//! t41). GA4's Data API (`properties.runReport` / `runRealtimeReport`) is fundamentally a *query*
//! surface — you ask for **metrics** grouped by **dimensions** over a **date range** with
//! **filters**, and GA aggregates server-side and returns rows. That maps onto the qfs
//! **relational archetype** with one honest constraint: GA is a **query source, never a mutate
//! target** (you do not `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`REMOVE` analytics data). Like the SQL driver, the
//! *entire* pipeline pushes down to one native `runReport` call (GA does the aggregation), so this
//! is a **pushdown target** (RFD §5 relational, §6 pushdown). It reuses the shared Google OAuth
//! base (t19) and the driver contract (t13).
//!
//! ## Surface
//! - [`GaDriver`] — the introspective `Driver`: `mount()` = `/ga`, the
//!   [`Archetype::RelationalTable`] per-node archetype + a typed [`Schema`] (the property's
//!   dimension+metric catalog), **`SELECT`-only** capabilities (every write verb absent ⇒ rejected
//!   at the parse-time gate), and a `Partial` [`PushdownProfile`] declaring
//!   `where_/project/limit/order/aggregate/group_by` (one `runReport` runs the whole query).
//! - [`GaApplier`] — the apply leg the contract returns from `applier()`. GA is **read-only**, so
//!   it rejects every effect with a structured [`GaError::ReadOnly`] (belt-and-suspenders behind
//!   the capability gate). Report rows flow through the pure read path ([`report`]), never here.
//! - [`ga_apply_driver`] — wraps the (reject-all) applier in a [`qfs_runtime::PlanApplierBridge`]
//!   ready to `register` under the driver id `ga`, so a (read) plan over `/ga` is routed correctly
//!   and any stray write is rejected end-to-end.
//!
//! ## Read-only enforcement (RFD §5/§10 — the honest archetype)
//! Read-only is enforced in **two** places that cannot drift apart:
//! 1. **Parse-time** — [`GaDriver::capabilities`] returns a `SELECT`-only set, so
//!    `qfs_driver::check_capability` rejects `INSERT`/`UPSERT`/`UPDATE`/`REMOVE` structurally
//!    before a `Plan` exists, with the supported-verb list for AI recovery.
//! 2. **Apply-time** — [`GaApplier`] rejects every effect, so even a hand-built plan that bypassed
//!    the gate cannot mutate GA. The least-privilege scope is `analytics.readonly` (never a
//!    broader Google scope, RFD §10).
//!
//! ## Query → `RunReportRequest` with a TRUTHFUL residual (the t20/t21 lesson)
//! [`compile::compile`] lowers a relational query (projection of dimension/metric names, `WHERE`,
//! `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`) into one [`compile::RunReportRequest`]. A `WHERE` conjunct is pushed as a
//! residual-dropping GA filter **only** when the GA filter means *exactly* the SQL predicate
//! (`dim = 'x'` → EXACT `stringFilter`; `metric > n` → `numericFilter`; the `date` predicate →
//! `dateRanges[]`). Every looser GA filter (`dim LIKE`/`~` → CONTAINS/FULL_REGEXP) is pushed as a
//! pre-filter and the exact predicate is **kept as residual** so the engine re-applies exact
//! filtering — over-fetch then filter, never wrong rows (RFD §6). `OR`/`NOT`/unsupported columns
//! stay wholly residual.
//!
//! ## Mandatory date range + catalog validation (RFD §5)
//! GA4 requires a date range on every core report; the compiler errors with
//! [`GaError::MissingDateRange`] (structured, AI-correctable) rather than fabricating one. A
//! projected/filtered name that is neither a catalog dimension nor metric yields
//! [`GaError::UnknownField`] — turning a would-be raw GA 400 into a self-correctable error. A
//! realtime report (`/ga/<property>/realtime`) needs no date range (the last ~30 minutes).
//!
//! ## Auth + multi-account + least privilege (RFD §10)
//! Auth (tokens, refresh, multi-account) comes from t19; credential storage from t27. The bearer
//! is injected by the t19 `GoogleApiClient` and lives behind a [`qfs_secrets::Secret`]; it is
//! **never** logged, never in a DTO, never in a [`GaError`]. Multi-account is the t19 base: one
//! `GoogleApiClient` per account (and the GA property id selects which property under that
//! account); the driver is account-agnostic (the resolved account is bound at client
//! construction).
//!
//! ## No vendor leak (RFD §9)
//! GA4 JSON is translated into owned DTOs at the [`client`] boundary; the `Driver` surface and the
//! compiled request carry zero google types. The HTTP client is behind the mockable [`GaClient`]
//! trait so it mocks in tests (no live GA, no network) and `reqwest` stays in `qfs-driver-http` —
//! this crate rides the t19 `HttpExchange` seam.
//!
//! ## Named parks (deferred)
//! - **Sampling / quota — surfaced, backoff via the runtime.** [`report::ReportResponse`] carries
//!   a `sampled` flag (from `metadata.samplingMetadatas`); the GA4 quota `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
//!   maps to a retryable 429 [`GaError`] so the runtime's t12 retry/circuit-breaker backs off. A
//!   dedicated sampling marker *column* and per-property quota accounting are follow-ups.
//! - **`checkCompatibility` pre-flight — catalog-driven validation present.** Unknown fields are
//!   rejected against the catalog ([`GaError::UnknownField`]); the GA `checkCompatibility`
//!   round-trip for incompatible dimension×metric *combinations* is a follow-up.
//! - **Service-account credential path — credential store is t27.** The `analytics.readonly`
//!   OAuth path is wired; a service-account JWT path for unattended server reports lands with the
//!   credential-store work.
