//! The structured Gmail driver error (RFD-0001 §5: errors are machine-readable for an AI,
//! never prose, and **never** secret-bearing). Every arm carries a stable [`GmailError::code`]
//! and a secret-free message: a path, a verb label, an HTTP status, an account email (a
//! low-sensitivity id), or a fixed reason — **never** a token, a header value, or a message
//! body. The auth base's [`AuthError`](qfs_google_auth::AuthError) is mapped in at the
//! boundary so no auth-internal type leaks past the driver, and the token discipline of t19
//! (the bearer lives behind a [`qfs_secrets::Secret`] and the redacting `HttpRequest` `Debug`)
//! is preserved by construction.
