//! WHERE → Slack `conversations.history` query-param pushdown (blueprint §7 "push down what the
//! backend runs natively; combine residual filters locally").
//!
//! ## Scoped to `oldest`/`latest`/`limit` (the ticket scopes richer pushdown to E3)
//! `conversations.history`/`.replies` accept a **time window** + a page size as native params:
//! `oldest`/`latest` bound the message `ts` range and `limit` caps the page. The planner lowers a
//! typed `WHERE` on the `ts` column into these params; anything Slack cannot express stays
//! **residual** for the engine to filter locally.
//!
//! ## The t20 lesson — TRUTHFUL residual (the headline invariant)
//! Slack's `oldest`/`latest` window params are **inclusive** bounds on `ts`. So the truthfulness of
//! dropping the residual depends on the comparison operator:
//! - `ts >= X` → `oldest=X` and `ts <= X` → `latest=X` are **exact** (inclusive ≡ inclusive), so
//!   the conjunct **drops** from the residual.
//! - `ts >  X` → `oldest=X` and `ts <  X` → `latest=X` are a **lossy pre-filter**: Slack's
//!   inclusive bound also returns the `ts == X` boundary row, so the **strict** comparison is
//!   **kept as residual** to re-exclude that one row locally. Dropping it here would over-return a
//!   wrong row — exactly the t20 defect.
//!
//! Any other predicate (`text LIKE`, `user =`, `OR`, …) Slack cannot push, so it is **kept**
//! residual and the engine re-filters locally — over-fetch then filter, never wrong rows. This
//! module is the pure translation: it builds the param list + the residual; it performs **no I/O**
//! and holds no token.
