//! The [`CombineEngine`] seam and the in-house [`MiniEvaluator`] (ADR-0002).
//!
//! [`CombineEngine`] is the trait that keeps the DuckDB-vs-own decision reversible: a
//! `DuckDbEngine` could implement it behind a non-default feature without touching
//! callers. The shipped impl is [`MiniEvaluator`], which walks a
//! [`PhysicalPlan`](qfs_pushdown::PhysicalPlan), pulling one [`RowBatch`] per native
//! [`Scan`](qfs_pushdown::PhysicalPlan::Scan) from the supplied [`ScanResults`] and
//! folding each local [`Combine`](qfs_pushdown::PhysicalPlan::Combine) op over its inputs.
