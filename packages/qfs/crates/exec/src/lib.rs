//! `qfs-exec` — the **execution / integration layer** (ticket t29): the end-to-end SELECT
//! read-path executor (the t20 carry-over closure) plus the one-shot CLI execution orchestration
//! (statement-source resolution, addressing validation, the PREVIEW/COMMIT safety gate, output
//! rendering, and the stable exit-code contract). The thin `qfs` bin / `qfs-cmd` dispatches into
//! [`run_oneshot`]; all the composition lives here.
//!
//! ## Crate topology (the t29 architectural decision)
//! `qfs-runtime`'s spine is deliberately `{qfs-plan, qfs-types}` and must not gain `qfs-core` /
//! `qfs-pushdown` / `qfs-engine`; `qfs-cmd` must stay logic-free (the t01 C4 guard forbids it a
//! direct `qfs-lang/plan/driver/codec/parser` dep). The read executor needs
//! `qfs-pushdown + qfs-engine + qfs-core` and async scans. So it lives **here**, in a new
//! integration crate that sits ABOVE the spine and composes those pieces. Every existing
//! confinement holds:
//!  - **Runtime minimal spine** — `qfs-exec` does **not** depend on `qfs-runtime`; it owns its
//!    own async [`ReadDriver`](read::ReadDriver) read seam (the runtime's write `ApplyDriver`
//!    only returns affected counts, never rows, so it is structurally not a read seam). The
//!    runtime confinement guard fires only on `qfs-runtime` consumers, so it is untouched.
//!  - **cmd logic-free** — `qfs-cmd → qfs-exec` is allowed (C4 forbids only
//!    `qfs-lang/plan/driver/codec/parser`; `qfs-exec` is none of them).
//!  - **No spine inversion** — nothing in the pure spine depends back onto `qfs-exec`, so tokio
//!    stays out of the spine's closure (`qfs-plan`'s purity dep-closure test is unaffected).
