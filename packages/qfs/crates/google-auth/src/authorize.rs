//! The interactive **paste-back authorization** flow (blueprint §8) — native-only.
//!
//! `authorize` runs the OAuth2 desktop-app consent flow entirely over the terminal, the way
//! gmail-ftp does: build the consent URL with `redirect_uri=http://localhost` (no port — and
//! **no listener**), show it to the human, let them approve in **any** browser (their laptop's,
//! over SSH — the redirect never needs to reach this host), then read back the
//! `http://localhost/?state=…&code=…` URL their browser lands on (or the bare `code=` value),
//! validate `state`, exchange the code for tokens, look up the profile email, persist the
//! refresh token under `google:<email>:refresh_token`, and return the [`GoogleAccount`].
//!
//! ## Why paste-back, not a loopback listener
//! A loopback `TcpListener` can only receive the redirect when the approving browser runs on
//! THIS host. The primary qfs environment is SSH-to-a-server: the browser is on the user's own
//! machine, its `http://localhost/...` redirect lands on *their* loopback, and no listener here
//! ever sees it. Paste-back works in both worlds — Google checks that the token request's
//! `redirect_uri` EQUALS the consent URL's, not that anything answered at it — so it is THE
//! flow, with no listener variant to fall back to.
//!
//! ## wasm note
//! This whole module is `cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))`: Workers provision refresh tokens
//! out of band, using only [`crate::source::StoredTokenSource`]. Keeping `authorize`
//! feature-gated lets the refresh-only path compile to `wasm32`.
//!
//! ## Consent itself is interactive
//! Approving in a browser and pasting the redirect back is a human act, out of scope for
//! automated tests; everything *around* it — auth-URL shape, pasted-input parsing, `state`
//! validation, token exchange, profile keying, refresh-token persistence — is exercised
//! hermetically by injecting a [`ConsentPrompt`] that answers with a scripted paste.
