//! [`GoogleApiClient`] — the reusable **authenticated Google API client** the Gmail (t20),
//! Drive (t21), and Analytics (t41) drivers issue their API calls through (blueprint §6/§8).
//!
//! It wraps the thin [`HttpExchange`] seam and a [`TokenSource`]: for each request it injects the
//! current bearer access token into an `Authorization` header, sends it, and — on a **401** —
//! invalidates the cached token, refreshes once, and **retries exactly once**. A second 401 (or
//! a non-401 error) is returned to the driver to classify. This is the "refresh on 401" loop the
//! ticket calls for, factored out so each Google driver reuses it rather than re-implementing.
//!
//! ## Boundary discipline
//! The client trades only in the owned [`HttpRequest`]/[`HttpResponse`] DTOs — the caller builds
//! the request (URL, method, body, non-auth headers); this client owns *only* the
//! `Authorization` header + the refresh-retry. The bearer value is read from the [`Secret`] at
//! send time and written into a header the [`HttpRequest`] `Debug` redacts; it never lands in a
//! log line or an error.
