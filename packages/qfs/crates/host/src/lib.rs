//! # `qfs-host` — the deployment host-adapter seam (t36, blueprint §10/§11)
//!
//! "The runtime is just what causes a plan to run" (blueprint §2). This crate is the ONE boundary that
//! abstracts *what causes a plan to run* over the two production targets — a long-lived **Linux/EC2
//! daemon** and a **`wasm32` Cloudflare Worker** — without inventing any new runtime semantics. The
//! closed-core grammar, the three `/server` registries (t30), the binding model, and the three
//! fire-path leaf bindings (`qfs-http`/`qfs-cron`/`qfs-watchtower`) are all untouched; t36 takes the
//! already-built effect-plan interpreter + server registry and runs them on each target.
//!
//! ## The seam
//! - [`RuntimeHost`] — `now` / `serve_endpoints` / `schedule_jobs` / `consume_events` / `durable` /
//!   `native_store`: the cause-attachment contract each host implements.
//! - [`DurableStore`] — `get` / `put` / `cas`: watcher cursors + `LAST_RUN` over DO storage (CF) or
//!   an fsync'd file (daemon); `cas` is the at-least-once idempotency primitive (blueprint §7).
//! - Owned, vendor-free DTOs: [`BindingSet`] (+ [`EndpointBinding`], [`JobBinding`],
//!   [`WebhookBinding`], [`WatcherBinding`], [`NativeStoreBinding`], [`Mount`],
//!   [`NativeStoreHandle`], [`Timestamp`], [`StateKey`], [`StateBytes`]). Produced by the t30
//!   registry, consumed identically by both hosts. NO `worker::*` / `tokio::*` / AWS / CF storage
//!   type ever crosses this seam (enforced by the cargo-metadata no-vendor-in-core deny test).
//!
//! ## What builds where (the two offline-dep constraints, ADR-0005)
//! - The **wasm-clean core** (this crate with `--no-default-features`): the traits, the DTOs, the
//!   host-agnostic binding-set [`derive`]ation, the [`wrangler`] generator, and the [`mock`]
//!   `MockHost`. Builds on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` — pulls NO tokio / worker.
//! - **`host-daemon`**: the EC2 side — [`bindings_from_state`] (the `qfs_server::ServerState` →
//!   [`BindingSet`] conversion; `qfs-server` pulls tokio `signal`, no-wasm), the fsync'd
//!   [`FileDurableStore`], and the on-disk [`AuditLedger`]. The daemon's `TokioHost: RuntimeHost`
//!   is composed in the terminal `qfs` binary, REUSING the existing `qfs-http`/`qfs-cron`/
//!   `qfs-watchtower` serve composition behind the trait — it is NOT rebuilt here.
//! - **`host-workers`**: the CF side — PARKED. The `worker` crate is not in the offline cache, so
//!   the real `#[event]` + `#[durable_object]` entrypoints are scaffolded (the
//!   archetype→primitive [`workers`] mapping + DTO wiring), drop-in once `worker` lands.
//!
//! The two host features are mutually exclusive in a single build (a `compile_error!` fires if
//! both are set — see below).

#[cfg(all(feature = "host-daemon", feature = "host-workers"))]
compile_error!(
    "qfs-host: `host-daemon` and `host-workers` are mutually exclusive in a single build (one \
