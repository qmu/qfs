//! The **Cloudflare Workers** host (behind `host-workers`): PARKED per blueprint §11.
//!
//! ## Why this is a scaffold, not the real `worker` entrypoints
//! The `worker` crate (the CF Workers Rust SDK) is **not in the offline cache** — it is not even
//! resolvable from the offline crates.io index on this host (verified: `cargo` reports "no
//! matching package named `worker`" under `--offline`). Per the ADR-0002/0003/0004 footprint
//! reasoning (an uncached heavy dependency tree on a ~99 %-full disk is exactly the risk those
//! ADRs were written to avoid), the real `worker`-crate `#[event(fetch/scheduled/queue)]` +
//! `#[durable_object]` entrypoints are **parked behind this feature** and documented in
//! blueprint §11. What ships now is the wasm-clean SCAFFOLD: the
//! binding-archetype → CF-primitive MAPPING and the DTO wiring, so the real entrypoints are
//! drop-in once `worker` lands.
//!
//! This module pulls NO `worker` dependency. It builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (it is owned
//! DTOs + the mapping table only). The functions below describe the mapping each real `#[event]`
//! handler will implement; they are the contract a reviewer checks the eventual handlers against.
