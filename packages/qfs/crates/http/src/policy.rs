//! The **policy gate** (t35, replacing the t32 read-only-default; blueprint §3 purity / §8
//! least-privilege).
//!
//! An endpoint serves the *query face* of qfs (pure reads route through the read path and
//! produce an empty commit plan), but a write-lowering endpoint COMMITs a write plan. That
//! plan is now enforced against the endpoint's bound [`qfs_server::Policy`] via the REAL pure
//! enforcer [`qfs_server::evaluate`] — the same `evaluate` the cron/watchtower committers use.
//! Enforced at BOTH:
//!   * **route compile** (registration): a write-lowering endpoint whose policy denies it never
//!     becomes a live route (the plan-assertion acceptance);
//!   * **request time** (defence in depth): even a hot-swapped route re-asserts before eval.
//!
//! Default-deny / fail-closed: a pure read (no write effects) passes; ANY write effect with no
//! granting policy (or a policy that denies the verb/driver) is a [`PolicyError`]. This is the
//! **may** layer; the t13 driver capability (**can**) is a distinct, earlier gate.
