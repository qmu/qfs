//! The invite + membership domain model (roadmap **M5 / t55**): the *joining* half of decision B
//! (every deployment holds its own `users`/`accounts`) — a host operator mints an [`Invite`], the
//! invitee REDEEMS it (one-time, expiring) to create their local identity and a [`Membership`]
//! linking them to the host (and, later, a project).
//!
//! These are plain owned DTOs — no vendor type, no live token. **Crucially, neither [`Invite`] nor
//! any DTO carries the raw invite token**: like a session token (t46) and the argon2id
//! `password_hash` (t45), the one-time invite secret is stored ONLY as a `sha256` digest and never
//! surfaced on a DTO a caller can read, log, or echo (blueprint §8). The plaintext token lives exactly
//! once — inside the [`InviteToken`] the binary mints and returns as the one-time URL at create.
//!
//! ## Identity ≠ authorization (§4.1)
//! A [`Membership`] grants *belonging* ("you are a member"), never *capability* ("you may touch X").
//! What a member may do stays default-deny until `POLICY` (t57). Do not let "is a member" leak into
//! an authorization decision — a [`Role`] here is a coarse label for a later ACL, not a grant.
