//! The consumer-side [`IdentityStore`] trait + its structured [`IdentityError`].
//!
//! This is the **seam**: the trait is owned-DTO only and carries no SQLite/rusqlite type, so the
//! domain stays a leaf. The concrete implementation (a `rusqlite` store over the System DB) is
//! INJECTED by the binary — it lives in `qfs-store` (`SqliteIdentityStore`), the one crate that owns
//! a real DB connection. The dep-direction guard keeps that I/O out of this crate.
//!
//! Sign-up ([`IdentityStore::signup_local`]) is **one transaction** inserting a `users` row + a
//! `local` `accounts` row; a duplicate email or `(provider, subject)` returns a structured error, not
//! a panic. The plaintext password never reaches this trait — the binary hashes it (the plaintext is
//! zeroized) and hands in a [`PasswordHash`]. The lone method that needs the live password,
//! [`IdentityStore::verify_password`], takes a [`Secret`] and returns only a bool.
