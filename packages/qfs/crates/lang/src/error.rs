//! The lexer error type, carrying a [`Span`] for the structured-error path.
//!
//! Every lexer failure is reported as a [`LexError`] with the exact byte span of
//! the offending source (blueprint §6/§8): an unterminated string, a bad escape, a
//! stray character, or a malformed number. This mirrors the parser's owned
//! `ParseError` shape so the two diagnostic surfaces compose. The lexer never
//! panics; arbitrary input yields `Ok` or `Err`, never an abort.
