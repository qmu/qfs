//! [`KEYWORDS`] is the single committed fixture (fidelity guard G1 / acceptance
//! criterion C1): the golden test in `lib`'s `tests` module asserts against *this*
//! slice, so there is no second hand-transcription that could drift out of sync.
//! Multi-word forms (`GROUP BY`, `INSERT INTO`, `MATERIALIZED VIEW`) are stored as
//! their canonical multi-word strings to match §3 exactly; lexing nuance is E1's
//! concern, not the golden lock's.

/// A reserved keyword in the qfs closed core.
///
/// Each variant carries no data; the canonical surface text is obtained via
/// [`Keyword::text`]. The enum exists so later epics can pattern-match keywords
/// exhaustively (the compiler then flags any unhandled keyword), while [`KEYWORDS`]
/// remains the flat golden fixture the freeze test locks.
