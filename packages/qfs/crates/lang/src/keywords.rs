//! The frozen reserved-keyword set, transcribed from blueprint §3 ("Closed core
//! keywords (reserved, frozen)") in their **canonical lowercase** spelling.
//!
//! ## Case policy (M6, ticket t74, roadmap decision S)
//! Keywords are **lowercase** (`where`, `select`, `let`, `insert into`, `join`,
//! `policy`, …): paths, column names, and bindings carry the visual weight, so the
//! closed keyword set stays quiet. Recognition is **case-insensitive** — the lexer
//! folds a word's case before matching ([`Keyword::from_word`]), so `SELECT`,
//! `Select`, and `select` all lex to the same [`Keyword`] — but the **canonical /
//! rendered** form ([`Keyword::text`], [`KEYWORDS`], the EBNF, the generated docs, and
//! error messages) is lowercase. This was a deliberate readability decision, **not** a
//! new capability or a semantic change; the count below is untouched (39 stays 39 — only
//! the *case* of the strings changes). Accepting any case keeps every pre-t74 uppercase
//! corpus query valid while making lowercase the one blessed form.
//!
//! [`KEYWORDS`] is the single committed fixture (fidelity guard G1 / acceptance
//! criterion C1): the golden test in `lib`'s `tests` module asserts against *this*
//! slice, so there is no second hand-transcription that could drift out of sync.
//! Multi-word forms (`group by`, `insert into`, `materialized view`) are stored as
//! their canonical multi-word strings to match §3 exactly; lexing nuance is E1's
//! concern, not the golden lock's.

/// A reserved keyword in the qfs closed core.
///
/// Each variant carries no data; the canonical surface text is obtained via
/// [`Keyword::text`]. The enum exists so later epics can pattern-match keywords
/// exhaustively (the compiler then flags any unhandled keyword), while [`KEYWORDS`]
/// remains the flat golden fixture the freeze test locks.
