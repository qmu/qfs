//! The four MCP tools (t47) + the injected [`McpEngine`] seam.
//!
//! The tools map 1:1 to qfs's operating loop (roadmap §2.2): **describe → preview → commit**, plus
//! **connections** for discovery. The handlers here are PURE protocol/shape logic over an injected
//! [`McpEngine`]: the actual reads/plans/applies live behind the trait, supplied by the `qfs`
//! binary's serve composition root (so this crate stays off the live driver / runtime edge).
//!
//! ## The safety floor is inherited verbatim (non-negotiable)
//! - `describe` is PURE — no credentials, no I/O, no network.
//! - `preview` applies ZERO effects — it only builds the plan and renders its dry-run summary.
//! - `commit` routes through the SAME default-deny policy gate ([`qfs_server::gate_plan`]) and the
//!   SAME [`qfs_core::IrreversibleGuard`] the CLI uses. An out-of-policy plan is REFUSED with the
//!   policy decision; an irreversible plan (`REMOVE` / `CALL`) WITHOUT `ack` is REFUSED (a legible
//!   "needs human approval" result), never silently applied. No privileged shortcut exists.
//! - `connections` returns names + metadata only, through the SAME redaction as
//!   `qfs account list` — never secret material.
//!
//! Upstream engine errors are surfaced as the owned, secret-free [`EngineError`] (code + message
//! only — no token, path-secret, or stack leak), reported in-band as an `isError` tool result so a
//! client model gets a legible failure rather than a transport fault.
