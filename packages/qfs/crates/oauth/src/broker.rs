//! t66 (roadmap **M9** — Managed Team / §3.2/§3.3): the **OAuth-brokering domain model** — the
//! pure request/grant types + the security gates behind qfs Cloud brokering a token to a *team's*
//! connection, so members act *as the team* without ever registering a personal OAuth client.
//!
//! ## The brokering model (decision: qfs Cloud is the OAuth client)
//! In the managed tier qfs Cloud holds **one** broker OAuth client registration per upstream
//! provider (the broker `client_id` + the `client_secret` — the crown jewel). Instead of every
//! self-hosted deployment registering its own client with Google/GitHub/Slack and minting its own
//! tokens, the broker mints a **team-scoped** token and hands it to the team's connection. A member
//! then USES that brokered connection *as the team*, bounded by the t57/t81 actor-policy — never by
//! who holds the token (§3.3 two-layer identity: the connection is the upstream authority, the actor
//! is the human).
//!
//! ## What is here (the hermetic CORE) vs. the live broker (a documented SEAM)
//! The live qfs Cloud broker is a **network service that does not exist to test against**, so this
//! module ships only the testable core:
//! - the **request/grant types** ([`BrokerTokenRequest`], [`BrokeredGrant`], [`BrokeredToken`]);
//! - the [`Broker`] trait — the SEAM the live qfs Cloud broker endpoint implements over the network
//!   (the binary's commit path calls it; production swaps a network impl behind the same trait —
//!   that impl is NOT in this repo and is NOT claimed to work);
//! - an in-memory [`FixtureBroker`] — the **reference + hermetic** impl the tests (and the binary's
//!   provisioning tests) drive, so the whole brokering model is exercised with no network/credentials;
//! - the **security gates** ([`Broker::broker_token`] refuses a non-member; [`assert_team_scope`]
//!   refuses cross-team replay) that make brokering safe by construction.
//!
//! ## Secret discipline (blueprint §8)
//! Two secrets exist here and BOTH are carried only inside the redacting, zeroized [`Secret`]:
//! - the broker **client secret** — held by the broker, **never** placed in a [`BrokeredGrant`], a
//!   log, or any value that crosses to a team or a member (it is the broker's alone);
//! - the **brokered token** — bound to a team; it rides inside [`BrokeredToken`] next to a
//!   secret-free [`BrokeredGrant`] descriptor (team / provider / scope / `client_id`) so everything a
//!   log or `/sys/connections` view touches is metadata, never a credential.
//!
//! The brokered token is **derived from** the broker client secret + the team + provider + scope (a
//! one-way `sha256`), so a fixture token is reproducibly bound to its team WITHOUT ever exposing the
//! client secret — the same property the live broker gives by minting a real upstream token scoped to
//! the team.
