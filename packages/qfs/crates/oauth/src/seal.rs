//! t78: the pure **audit-chain seal** (signed checkpoint) primitives [`sign_seal`] / [`verify_seal`]
//! over the existing ES256 JWS (roadmap **decision V** / §4.6).
//!
//! ## What a seal IS
//! A *seal* (a.k.a. a signed checkpoint) is a short, signed statement over the audit chain HEAD
//! (t76): the head's `(seq, content_hash, prev_hash)` plus the wall-clock `issued_at` it was minted
//! at. It is signed with the SAME AS ES256 key that signs access tokens ([`crate::sign_jws`]), so an
//! independent verifier — holding only the published [`Jwks`] — can confirm three things at once:
//!
//! 1. **Authenticity** — the seal was issued by THIS authorization server (the signature verifies
//!    against the AS public key resolved by the header `kid`), not forged by whoever controls the
//!    audit store.
//! 2. **Position** — the chain reached exactly `seq` events, with this `content_hash`/`prev_hash`
//!    head. Because the seal lands in an append-only witness *outside* the server (t78's WORM /
//!    transparency-log seam), a compromised server cannot later truncate or fork the chain below a
//!    sealed `seq` without contradicting an anchor it can no longer change.
//! 3. **Time** — when the head was sealed (`issued_at`), so a consumer can order seals and bound how
//!    far back tamper-evidence extends.
//!
//! ## Why it lives in `qfs-oauth` (pure), not the binary
//! Like [`crate::sign_jws`]/[`crate::verify_access_token`], a seal is protocol logic with no I/O: it
//! takes the head fields + the AS [`SigningKey`] (sign) or a token + the published [`Jwks`] (verify)
//! and returns a value. Keeping it here makes it golden-vector testable against a fixed key with zero
//! credentials, and reuses the vetted JWS path rather than minting a second signature format. The
//! IMPURE halves — reading the durable head, recomputing the chain over a consumer's stored events,
//! and handing the seal to a WORM witness — live binary-side (`crates/qfs/src/worm.rs`), which is the
//! ONLY place that owns the System DB, the AS key material, and a real WORM target (decision F/V).
//!
//! ## A seal is NOT an access token (a confusion guard)
//! Every seal carries a fixed [`SEAL_KIND`] discriminator in its claims, and [`verify_seal`] rejects
//! any token that does not carry it ([`SealError::WrongKind`]). So a seal can never be replayed as a
//! bearer token, and an access token can never masquerade as a seal — even though both are ES256 JWS
//! signed by the same key. (The mirror of the `alg=ES256` algorithm-confusion guard in
//! [`crate::verify_jws`].)
//!
//! ## Metadata only (blueprint §8)
//! A seal carries ONLY chain-position metadata — sequence number, two content/link hashes, and a
//! timestamp. There is structurally NOWHERE to put a secret or a row's payload, exactly the boundary
//! the audit event itself enforces (t76). The private signing key never appears in a seal; only the
//! signature it produced does.
