//! The owned, vendor-free qfs AST (RFD-0001 §2.2 pipe-SQL, §3 closed core, §4 data
//! model). This is the **full** grammar surface (t04), promoted from the E0 spike
//! subset: every downstream subsystem (effect-plan, runtime, drivers, server DDL)
//! consumes these sum types.
//!
//! ## Closed core, structurally enforced (RFD §3)
//! The closed-core thesis — "new backend = zero new keywords" — is enforced *by the
//! shape of these enums*: [`Statement`] and [`PipeOp`] have **no** per-driver,
//! per-action variant, and they are NOT `#[non_exhaustive]` here precisely so a
//! governance test (`grammar`/`lib` tests) can lock their variant set. Everything a
//! driver contributes flows through exactly three **string-named** open seams:
//! [`PathExpr`] (the path/mount registry), [`CallRef`]/[`FnRef`] (the
//! function/procedure registry), and [`Codec`] (the codec registry). A driver can
//! never add an AST node; it can only supply a name inside one of these.
//!
//! ## Owned DTOs / no vendor leak (RFD §9)
//! Nothing here depends on winnow or any driver/vendor crate. Spans are the
//! `qfs_lang::Span` byte-range primitive (shared with the lexer); literals are owned
//! `std` types. `serde::Serialize` powers `-json` AST dumps and the golden tests.
//!
//! ## Purity (RFD §3 purity invariant)
//! The AST is **data**: it describes a statement, it does not execute one. `INSERT`
//! vs `UPSERT` is preserved as a distinct [`EffectVerb`] so the runtime can pick a
//! retry-safe verb (RFD §6); `CALL` is a plan-constructing reference node, never an
//! effect.
