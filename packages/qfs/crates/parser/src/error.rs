//! The owned parse error (fidelity guard G6, blueprint §11 "owned DTOs / no vendor leaks").
//!
//! The chosen parser library is **winnow** (see blueprint §11),
//! but no winnow type appears here or anywhere in `qfs-parser`'s public API. winnow's
//! `ParseError`/`ContextError` is mapped into this owned type at the crate boundary,
//! so E1+ can swap the parser library without breaking any caller.
//!
//! The error carries exactly the AI-critical structured-error payload of blueprint §6/§8:
//! a byte span, a non-empty expected-set, and a machine-readable code, so an agent
//! can self-correct.
//!
//! ## Secret hygiene (blueprint §8)
//! The error `Display` never echoes literal *values*. The `found`/`message` fields
//! describe the *kind* of token encountered (e.g. `a string literal`), not its
//! contents, so a credential-bearing statement cannot leak through a diagnostic.
