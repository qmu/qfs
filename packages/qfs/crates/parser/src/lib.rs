//! `qfs-parser` — the parser front door (RFD-0001 §2.2, §3, §9).
//!
//! t04 promotes the E0/t02 skeleton to the **full RFD §3 pipe-SQL grammar**: the
//! parser library is **winnow** (locked in `docs/adr/0001-parser-library.md`), now
//! driven over the **t03 token stream** (`qfs_lang::lex` → `Vec<Spanned<Token>>`)
//! rather than over raw text. It parses the closed-core statement grammar — queries
//! (`FROM … |> op …`), effects (`INSERT/UPSERT/UPDATE/REMOVE … RETURNING`), codecs
//! (`DECODE/ENCODE`), `CALL`, server DDL (`CREATE …`), and the `PREVIEW/COMMIT`
//! plan wrappers — into the owned [`ast`] sum types.
//!
//! ## Closed core + three open registries (RFD §3 governance)
//! The grammar is **closed**: [`ast::Statement`] and [`ast::PipeOp`] carry no
//! per-driver/per-action variant (a governance test locks their variant count), so a
//! driver can never add an AST node. The only extension points are the three
//! **string-named** registry seams the grammar already has slots for: paths/mounts
//! ([`ast::PathExpr`]), functions & procedures ([`ast::FnRef`]/[`ast::CallRef`]), and
//! codecs ([`ast::Codec`]). Names inside those seams are parsed but **not resolved**
//! — resolution / capability gating is the semantic phase (E2). Unknown core
//! constructs (incomplete multi-word keywords, reserved words as identifiers) are rejected at
//! parse time with a structured [`ParseError`].
//!
//! ## Reversibility (fidelity guard G6, boundary B6)
//! winnow appears ONLY in the crate-private [`grammar`] module; the public API is the
//! owned [`ParseError`] and the owned [`ast`] types — no winnow type leaks past the
//! crate boundary, so the parser library stays swappable. Asserted by
//! [`tests::no_vendor_type_in_public_api`].
//!
//! ## Reserved upward edge (acceptance criterion C5)
//! The intended dependency direction is `qfs-core → qfs-parser`; `qfs-parser` must
//! never depend on `qfs-core` (no cycle). See `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
//!
//! ## wasm-friendliness (boundary guard B7)
//! winnow has zero transitive deps and is macro-free/pure-Rust, so the parser adds no
//! threads, `std::fs`, or sockets. serde (`derive`) powers `-json` AST dumps and the
//! golden tests; it is likewise pure.
