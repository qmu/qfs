//! schema-threading `PlanSource`). One variant per closed-core query operator; **no
//! effect variants** (effects pass through the effect-plan, never this pass).
//!
//! Crucially, the expression-bearing nodes carry the **expression/predicate**, not just
//! a schema (O-t07-3): [`LogicalPlan::Filter`] carries a [`Predicate`], [`Join`] carries
//! its `on` predicate, [`Project`]/[`Aggregate`] carry the column/aggregator lists — so
