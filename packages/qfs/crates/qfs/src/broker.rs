//! t66 (roadmap **M9** — Managed Team / §3.2/§3.3): the binary-side **team-connection provisioning +
//! brokered-USE** seam — where the pure brokering model ([`qfs_oauth`] `broker`) meets the real
//! envelope-encrypted store (t43) and the t81 shared-connection gate.
//!
//! ## What this module owns (the hermetic CORE)
//! - [`provision_team_connection`] — drive a [`Broker`] (the [`FixtureBroker`] in tests, the live qfs
//!   Cloud network broker in production behind the SAME trait) to mint a team-scoped token, then
//!   store it **envelope-encrypted** in the Project DB (t43) and record the ownership + brokering
//!   metadata rows (t81 `shared_connection` + t66 `broker_connection`). A **non-member is refused with
//!   no secret stored** — the broker returns no token, so nothing is sealed.
//! - [`provision_broker_client_registration`] — persist the broker's **client secret**
//!   envelope-encrypted at rest (the crown jewel goes through the SAME t43 envelope as any
//!   credential; it is never written in the clear).
//! - [`resolve_brokered_secret`] — the USE-time gate composition: a brokered connection's secret
//!   decrypts only after (1) the acting member belongs to the connection's TEAM (t66 team scope) AND
//!   (2) their t57/t81 actor-policy grants the connection's scope. Either gate failing refuses the
//!   bind **without decrypting** (default-deny — no secret crosses to an unauthorized actor).
//!
//! ## What is a documented SEAM (not in this repo, not claimed to work)
//! The **live qfs Cloud broker endpoint** is a network service that does not exist to test against.
//! It implements [`Broker`] over the network (holding the real upstream client registration and
//! exchanging for a real provider token scoped to the team); the binary's commit path
//! (`crates/qfs/src/commit.rs` `networked_credential`/`live_registry`) would call it exactly where it
//! calls the fixture here. This module proves the brokering DATA MODEL + provisioning + gates; it does
//! NOT ship a working qfs Cloud broker.
//!
//! ## Open product decision (FLAGGED, not baked in)
//! The brokering topology — does qfs Cloud hold the team refresh token **centrally**, or does each
//! tenant's **Project DB** hold the brokered token (sealed under t43)? — is managed-tier shaped. This
//! module implements the **tenant-Project-DB-at-rest** choice (it is the hermetically testable one)
//! and leaves the central-custody variant to the live-broker seam. The per-user-override precedence
//! over a team default (resolve.rs ladder) is likewise a managed-tier policy call to confirm in the PR.
