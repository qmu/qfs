//! The real `qfs run --commit` apply path: drives the `qfs-runtime` [`Interpreter`] over a live
//! driver registry to apply an effect `Plan` to the World. Injected into `qfs-cmd` as the
//! [`qfs_exec::WorldApply`] hook.
//!
//! `qfs-cmd` and `qfs-exec` are deliberately confined off `qfs-runtime` (the interpreter is the
//! sole impure stage). The terminal binary is the allowlisted runtime leaf that owns the
//! interpreter + the live drivers, so the real commit composition lives here — exactly like the
//! shell / serve / connection launchers.
//!
//! Today the registry carries the **local filesystem** driver (no credentials needed), which
//! proves the commit path is real end to end: `qfs run "UPSERT INTO /local/… " --commit` actually
//! writes the file. Credentialed / networked drivers register here behind their live clients as
//! they land (the execution+auth ticket).
