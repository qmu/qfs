//! The `qfs connection` composition root: the real credential-store I/O that backs
//! `qfs connection add/list/use/remove`, injected into `qfs-cmd` as the [`qfs_cmd::ConnectionLauncher`].
//!
//! `qfs-cmd` may not depend on the concrete `qfs-secrets` backend (the dep_direction guard), so —
//! exactly like the shell / serve / describe launchers — the binary owns this and `qfs-cmd` only
//! parses the verb and calls in.
//!
//! ## Security (RFD §10)
//! - The credential **value** is read from **stdin**, never from argv (argv leaks into shell
//!   history and `ps`).
//! - Credentials live in the envelope-encrypted SQLite **Project DB** ([`crate::secret_store`]):
//!   a random data-key (DEK) encrypts each secret value (ChaCha20-Poly1305), and the DEK is wrapped
//!   under a key derived from the `QFS_PASSPHRASE` env var (argon2id) — the t43 replacement for the
//!   old file vault. The active-connection selection lives in the DB's `active_account` table (no
//!   passphrase needed — selectors only). Secrets are never printed, logged, or echoed.
