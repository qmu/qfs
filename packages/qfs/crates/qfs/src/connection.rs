//! The **credential-store plumbing + the connect layer's CLI I/O**: opening the envelope-encrypted
//! vault (the passphrase / keychain guardians), the sign-in gate, the rotation/rekey audit
//! emitter, and the `qfs connect` / `qfs disconnect` / `qfs connect --list` defined-path verbs —
//! injected into `qfs-cmd` as the [`qfs_cmd::ConnectionLauncher`]. The credentialed
//! `qfs connection` verb NAMESPACE is retired (ADR 0008 §3): accounts live under `qfs account`,
//! app registrations under `qfs app`, the store re-wrap under `qfs vault rekey`, and the account
//! a statement runs as comes off the MOUNT — selection state (`active_account`) is dropped by
//! migration #11.
//!
//! `qfs-cmd` may not depend on the concrete `qfs-secrets` backend (the dep_direction guard), so —
//! exactly like the shell / serve / describe launchers — the binary owns this and `qfs-cmd` only
//! parses the verb and calls in.
//!
//! ## Security (RFD §10)
//! - A credential **value** is read from **stdin**, never from argv (argv leaks into shell
//!   history and `ps`).
//! - Credentials live in the envelope-encrypted SQLite **Project DB** ([`crate::secret_store`]):
//!   a random data-key (DEK) encrypts each secret value (ChaCha20-Poly1305), and the DEK is
//!   wrapped once per KeyGuardian slot (ADR 0008 §5). Secrets are never printed, logged, or
//!   echoed.
