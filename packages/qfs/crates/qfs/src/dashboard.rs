//! The embedded **SPA dashboard shell** (ticket t51): the *second of the three faces* of the one
//! qfs engine. A static single-page app — compiled INTO the `qfs` binary — that the in-house HTTP
//! listener serves over loopback, plus a thin JSON bridge that forwards a browser-composed qfs
//! statement into the SAME `describe → preview` engine path the CLI and the MCP face already use.
//!
//! ## One engine, three faces — no privileged shortcut
//! The bridge does NOT re-implement an executor. It drives the injected [`qfs_mcp::McpEngine`] — the
//! exact engine the t47 `POST /mcp` face is built on — so the dashboard, the CLI, and MCP all share
//! one statement-execution adapter. The constraint the roadmap names is enforced from day one: the
//! dashboard exposes **no capability the CLI/MCP lack**.
//!
//! ## describe + preview + the t52 approval-card commit
//! - `describe` is PURE (no creds, no I/O, no network) — exactly `qfs describe <path>`.
//! - `preview` builds the effect plan and renders its secret-free dry-run summary, applying ZERO
//!   effects (exactly the MCP `preview` tool). `POST /api/run` stays preview/read only; a `commit`
//!   *mode* there is still refused (the apply path is the dedicated, gated `/api/commit`).
//! - `commit` (t52) routes a previewed statement through the SAME single commit path the MCP
//!   `commit` tool uses ([`qfs_mcp::commit_plan`]): the default-deny policy gate
//!   (`qfs_server::gate_plan`) THEN the [`qfs_core::IrreversibleGuard`]. A reversible in-policy
//!   plan auto-applies (roadmap §2.4 *Autonomous-in-policy*); an out-of-policy plan is REFUSED with
//!   the decision; an irreversible plan (REMOVE / CALL) WITHOUT an explicit ack is REFUSED with a
//!   legible "needs human approval" signal — the dashboard's one-time approval card supplies that
//!   ack as `ack=true` on a second, explicit confirm. The card gets NO capability the CLI/MCP lack.
//!
//! ## Secret discipline (blueprint §8)
//! The bridge never returns credential material: describe is pure, the preview is a secret-free
//! plan summary, the commit outcome carries only the secret-free dry-run summary / per-effect
//! `"<VERB> <driver>:<path>"` labels, and engine errors are surfaced as the owned, secret-free
//! [`qfs_mcp::EngineError`] (`{ "error": { "code", "message" } }`) — never a raw upstream error,
//! token, or path-secret. The browser-supplied statement is parsed and planned through the normal
//! pipeline (no string-splicing), so a request value carries zero parse-time injection surface. No
//! connection/credential listing is served to the browser.
//!
//! ## Network posture — loopback-only; bearer-gating the commit is a documented follow-up
//! The shell is served loopback-only (the [`qfs_http::DEFAULT_BIND_ADDR`] default) and is NOT yet
//! gated on a session cookie or the t50 bearer token: t46/t50 opened the session/OAuth machinery
//! but no dashboard endpoint consumes a browser session→bearer mapping yet. Rather than invent a
//! bespoke auth surface, `/api/commit` keeps the loopback-only posture AND — crucially — inherits
//! the SAME default-deny policy gate the unauthenticated MCP surface relied on before its own
//! bearer gate: a dashboard commit can do nothing the engine's policy does not already grant, so it
//! opens no privileged, looser path to the network. Threading the t50 authorizer (and a single-use
//! ack token to defeat replay) through `/api/commit` is the called-out follow-up — flagged here
//! rather than half-wired.
//!
//! ## Self-contained assets (offline-clean)
//! The HTML/CSS/JS are embedded via [`include_str!`] (mirroring `qfs-skill`) so they SHIP in the
//! binary and are never dead-stripped — no external CDN/font/script, so `qfs serve` stays
//! offline-clean and the hermetic-test rule holds.
