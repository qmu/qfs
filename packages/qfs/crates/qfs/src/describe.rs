//! The `qfs describe` composition root (ticket t39): builds the **describe-only** driver
//! [`MountRegistry`] that the `qfs describe <path>` subcommand consults, and injects it into
//! `qfs-cmd` via the [`qfs_cmd::DescribeProvider`].
//!
//! ## DESCRIBE is PURE — so the registry is cred-free
//! `DESCRIBE` reads only the **introspective** half of the [`qfs_core::Driver`] contract
//! (`describe` / `capabilities` / `procedures` / `prelude` / `pushdown`) — it never reaches
//! `Driver::applier`, so no credential is resolved, no socket is opened, no I/O happens (RFD §3
//! purity invariant). Each driver is therefore constructed with its **public, cred-free mock
//! client** (`Mock*Client` — explicitly "no socket, no credentials") or a registry carrying a
//! representative bucket on a cred-free `MockObjectBackend` (s3/r2), which the introspective
//! half reads for capabilities but never *applies*.
//!
//! ## Why the binary owns this
//! qfs-cmd must stay off the concrete `qfs-driver-*` crates (the dep_direction guard). The binary
//! is the allowlisted leaf that may carry those edges, so the registry is built here and injected
//! — exactly like the t28 shell launcher and the t32 serve launcher.
//!
//! ## Coverage (the LIGHT facet of the CO-t29-1 driver-registration carry-over)
//! Registered cred-free (no backend registration needed for describe): **local, fs, mail, drive,
//! github, slack, ga, s3, r2**. The t68 `/fs` driver describes over an EMPTY (deny-all) root
//! allowlist — its pure introspective half names no host path. **sql / git / cf** require a
//! registered connection-catalog / repo
//! / D1-catalog for describe to resolve a concrete node (a *registration* requirement, not a
//! credential one), so their describe is covered by the `qfs-skill` golden corpus instead — where
//! the harness builds the registry with a fixture catalog. This is the documented fallback.
