//! ADR 0008 §2 — **`qfs init`**, the first-run wizard (EPIC 20260702120000 / ticket
//! 20260702120030). One command readies a fresh machine: it creates the **vault** (the
//! envelope-encrypted credential store, via the KeyGuardian passphrase flow) and registers the
//! **operator identity** — replacing the retired signup verb.
//!
//! ## No password — by design
//! Local authentication is the OS login: whoever can run the binary under this OS user *is* the
//! operator, and a password the CLI never verifies would be a liability, not security (the old
//! signup collected exactly that). The operator's email is an **accountability label**. The local
//! account row is created with an **unusable** password hash (32 CSPRNG bytes, hashed and
//! discarded), so nothing can authenticate with it on the verified surfaces (the t46 HTTP
//! sessions) until a real password is set there — fail closed, no secret collected.
//!
//! ## One `$HOME` = one operator (the invariant)
//! A second `init` with the SAME email is idempotent (reports what exists, exit 0 — safe to
//! re-run). A second `init` with a DIFFERENT email is refused with an actionable error: teams
//! never share a `$HOME`; they meet on a server host (ADR 0008 §1). This removes the old
//! second-signup cliff (`SoleUser::Many` bricking every cloud bind with no recovery).
