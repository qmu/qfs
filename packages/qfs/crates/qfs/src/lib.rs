#![cfg_attr(test, allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic))]
//! `qfs` library facet — the composition-root code shared by the `qfs` binary (`main.rs`)
//! and the `xtask` build tooling.
//!
//! The `qfs` crate is primarily the **single binary** (RFD-0001 §9). It also exposes this
//! thin library facet so two consumers can reuse the binary's *own* registries instead of
//! re-deriving them:
//!
//! - `main.rs` wires [`describe::describe_registry`], the serve launcher, the shell, etc.
//! - `xtask` (the build tool, never shipped) calls [`docs::gen_docs`], which renders the
//!   reference docs from [`catalog::driver_catalog`] — built by walking the **same**
//!   describe registry the binary ships. That is the anti-drift guarantee (t40): the docs
//!   are generated from the binary's live introspection surface, never authored twice.
//!
//! The modules that wire the runtime-coupled serve/shell/host facets (`serve`, `shell`,
//! `host`, `cron`, `watchtower`, `serve_builtins`) stay `pub(crate)`-only in spirit but are
//! exposed here as modules so `main.rs` can reference them through the crate root; nothing
//! outside this crate links the binary as a library except `xtask`, which touches only the
//! pure [`catalog`]/[`docs`]/[`version`] surface (no runtime, no creds, no I/O).
