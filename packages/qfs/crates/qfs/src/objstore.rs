//! The object-storage (`/s3`, `/r2`) composition root: the operator config the binary injects into
//! the live SigV4 [`HttpBackend`](qfs_driver_objstore::HttpBackend), plus the cred-free planning
//! registries the shell/serve engine mounts so an `/s3`/`/r2` statement PLANS.
//!
//! `qfs-driver-objstore` is a `qfs-runtime` consumer that must stay a LEAF — only the terminal
//! binary may depend on it — so the operator config (endpoint / region / bucket / access-key id)
//! lives HERE and the live SigV4 backend is constructed + bridged into the interpreter from the
//! binary (`crate::commit`), exactly like the local / fs / sql / git composition. DESCRIBE is a
//! pure, cred-free facet (registered in the describe registry); the live signed-HTTP backend is
//! built only on the apply registry.
//!
//! ## Config (no credentials) — fail closed by default
//! The **non-secret** routing config is read from the process environment; the **secret access
//! key** is resolved from the encrypted credential store (`crate::commit`), keyed by the
//! `objstore` provider and the MOUNT's account label — exactly the secret
//! `qfs account add objstore <label>` sealed (or the `QFS_SECRET_OBJSTORE_<LABEL>` env fallback
//! the agent/CI path reads). With ANY required
//! routing var absent the config is `None` and the driver is left UNREGISTERED — a `/s3` commit then
//! fails closed ("no driver / not configured"), never a silent or faked write.
//!
//! - **S3**: `QFS_S3_REGION` (e.g. `us-east-1`), `QFS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `QFS_S3_BUCKET`, and the
//!   optional `QFS_S3_ENDPOINT` (defaults to the virtual-host-free `https://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`).
//! - **R2**: `QFS_R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `QFS_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `QFS_R2_BUCKET`, and the optional
//!   `QFS_R2_ENDPOINT` (defaults to `https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`); the SigV4 region
//!   for R2 is the fixed sentinel `auto`.
//!
//! The access key id is NON-secret config (it appears in the SigV4 `Authorization` credential scope
//! on the wire); only the secret access key is a [`qfs_secrets::Secret`], envelope-encrypted at rest
//! and exposed only transiently inside the signer.
//!
//! ## One bucket per mount (a documented seam)
//! The [`ObjRegistry`](qfs_driver_objstore::ObjRegistry) resolves a backend by the path's `<bucket>`
//! segment, so the live registry registers the ONE operator-configured bucket
//! (`QFS_S3_BUCKET`/`QFS_R2_BUCKET`); a commit addressing any other bucket fails closed ("no such
//! registered bucket"). On-demand multi-bucket binding is a future extension behind the same seam.
