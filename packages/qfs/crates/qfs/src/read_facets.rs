//! The **networked read adapters** — the read counterparts of [`crate::shell::LocalReadDriver`],
//! hosted in the `qfs` binary crate. Each wraps a credentialed driver client behind the async
//! [`qfs_exec::ReadDriver`] seam so a `FROM /github/.../pulls` (or `FROM /slack/<ws>/users`)
//! executes through the read executor, the same way `LocalReadDriver` services `FROM /local/...`.
//!
//! ## Why the adapters live in the BINARY (the same CO-t29-4 topology as the local read facet)
//! `ReadDriver` is a `qfs-exec` type, and the driver crates must stay OFF `qfs-exec` (the
//! dep-direction confinement guard: a `qfs-runtime` consumer must be a leaf). qfs-exec cannot
//! depend on the driver crates either. The binary is the one node that is BOTH an allowlisted
//! runtime consumer AND a terminal sink, so the adapter that bridges the driver's pure
//! `read_rows` into the async `ReadDriver` lives here — exactly like `LocalReadDriver`,
//! `SysReadDriver`, and `ClaudeReadDriver`. The path→plan→fetch→decode logic itself lives INSIDE
//! each driver crate (`qfs_driver_github::read_rows` / `qfs_driver_slack::read_rows`), so this
//! adapter only owns the async boundary + the error mapping; it never re-derives the read logic.
//!
//! ## Fail closed (the ticket's honesty bar)
//! The adapter is registered (by [`crate::shell::run_engine_and_reads`]) only when the shared
//! [`crate::clients`] builder yields a credentialed client — i.e. the operator is configured and
//! the t54 cloud bind gate passed. When it is registered but the credential cannot be resolved at
//! request time (no token, locked store), the underlying client returns a structured auth error
//! and this adapter surfaces it as a [`CfsError`] carrying the driver's stable secret-free `code`
//! — **never** an empty `RowBatch`, never a panic. The SECRET never crosses this seam (the driver
//! errors are secret-free by construction; the planted-canary tests in each driver assert this).
