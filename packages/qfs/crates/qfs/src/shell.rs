//! The interactive-shell command boundary (ticket t28): the REPL driver + the concrete
//! local-FS read facet, hosted in the **`qfs` binary crate**. **All shell LOGIC lives in
//! `qfs_exec::shell`** (resolve / desugar / eval_line / Completer) — this module owns only the
//! glue a real terminal needs: the line reader, the history file, the prompt redraw, and
//! rendering an [`Outcome`] to stdout. Keeping the logic in `qfs-exec` respects the t01 C4 guard
//! (qfs-cmd stays logic-free) and the t29 CO-t29-4 topology (qfs-exec is the integration layer).
//!
//! ## Why the read adapter lives in the BINARY (not qfs-cmd)
//! `ls`/`cat`/`cd`-probe require a real [`qfs_exec::ReadDriver`] for the local mount. The local
//! driver (`qfs-driver-local`) cannot implement that trait itself (the CO-t29-4 guard lets only
//! qfs-cmd depend on qfs-exec), and qfs-exec cannot depend on the driver crate (the same guard
//! confines its deps). qfs-cmd cannot host the adapter either: `qfs-driver-local` is a
//! `qfs-runtime` consumer, so a `qfs-cmd → qfs-driver-local` edge would make qfs-cmd a non-leaf
//! runtime consumer and (correctly) trip the runtime-leaf-confinement guard. The **binary** is
//! the one place that is BOTH an allowlisted runtime consumer AND a leaf (nothing depends on it),
//! so tokio dead-ends here. The adapter [`LocalReadDriver`] — which drives the driver's pure
//! `scan_rows` through qfs-exec's async `ReadDriver` — therefore lives in the binary, which
//! injects the wired shell into `qfs-cmd` via its `ShellLauncher`. This closes part of CO-t29-1
//! for the local driver.
//!
//! ## Line editor footprint decision (recorded)
//! The ticket suggested `rustyline`/`reedline`. Neither is present in the offline cargo cache
//! (`cargo add rustyline --dry-run --offline` → "could not be found in registry index"), and the
//! disk is ~97% full, so adding a heavy editor dep is both impossible offline and against the
//! team's dependency-light precedent (ADR-0002/0003). We therefore ship a **minimal std stdin
//! line-reader** (a `read_line` loop with a best-effort in-memory + on-disk history list). The
//! [`Completer`] API is fully implemented and unit-tested; it is simply not bound to inline
//! TAB editing (which needs raw-mode terminal control a heavy editor would provide). The shell
//! core stays terminal-free and golden-testable regardless.
