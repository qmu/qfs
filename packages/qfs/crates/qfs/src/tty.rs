//! Interactive-terminal helpers — the human-facing side of credential entry.
//!
//! qfs is **stdin-pipe-first**: agents and scripts pipe secrets (never argv), and the credential
//! path reads them from stdin. That is perfect for automation but makes a *human's* first run a
//! copy-paste chore (`read -rs QFS_PASSPHRASE; export …` before every fresh pane).
//! These helpers add the missing INTERACTIVE path: when qfs is attached to a real terminal it
//! *prompts* — with echo disabled — instead of requiring the env var or a piped password.
//!
//! Two invariants keep this safe and automation-transparent:
//! - Every prompt is gated: values read from **stdin** ([`prompt_line`], the piped-credential
//!   entry) gate on [`is_interactive`] / [`stdin_is_terminal`]; the PASSPHRASE prompt reads the
//!   **controlling terminal** (`/dev/tty` — rpassword's default input), so it gates on
//!   [`can_prompt_secret`] instead and works even while stdin carries a piped secret
//!   (`cat credentials.json | qfs app add google`). With no controlling terminal (cron, CI) no
//!   prompt is ever reached and callers keep their non-interactive behavior.
//! - The prompt text is written to **stderr**, never stdout, so it never pollutes captured output;
//!   the secret is read with terminal echo OFF and lands in a zeroizing [`Secret`], never on argv,
//!   stdout, or the environment.
