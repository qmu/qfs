//! The DAG **frontier scheduler** (blueprint §7): yields successive ready-sets of effect
//! nodes whose dependencies are all satisfied, so the interpreter can batch and parallelise
//! a whole frontier at once (Haxl-style). This is the structural counterpart of
//! `qfs_plan::topo_order`, but *incremental* — it exposes one layer at a time and lets the
//! caller mark nodes done (or failed) as results arrive, which is what makes auto-batching
//! across the full frontier and skip-on-dependency-failure both correct under parallelism.
