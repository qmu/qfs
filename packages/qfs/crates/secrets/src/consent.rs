//! t54 (roadmap **M4** — the "Cloud tier"): the **pure consent / sign-in decision** that makes a
//! cloud driver unusable until a human has signed in to qfs identity AND granted that connection
//! explicit consent.
//!
//! This module is the *decision*, not the *I/O*. It holds two pure, secret-free pieces the binary's
//! composition root (`crates/qfs/src/connection.rs` + `crates/qfs/src/commit.rs`) wires the real
//! identity / consent state into:
//!
//! - [`is_cloud_driver`] — a static classification: a driver that talks to an external service over
//!   OAuth (gmail, gdrive, ga, github, slack, objstore, cf) is a **cloud** driver and sign-in is
//!   mandatory for it; everything else (the local filesystem, an on-disk git repo, the embedded SQL
//!   store, the `/sys` administration driver) is **local** and ungated.
//! - [`bind_gate`] — given "is the operator signed in?" and "is consent recorded for this
//!   connection?", returns `Ok(())` to proceed or a structured, secret-free [`ConsentError`] to
//!   refuse. The load-bearing M4 rule lives here: a cloud connection **fails closed** for an
//!   unauthenticated operator (decision B/C), and refuses to bind until consent was recorded
//!   (decision E).
//!
//! ## Why pure
//! The §3 purity invariant: a `Plan` carries a connection *selector*, never a secret/token — consent
//! and sign-in happen at **bind/commit time**, downstream of `describe`/`preview`. Keeping the
//! decision pure (no DB, no network, no `Secret`) lets the binary unit-test the gate hermetically and
//! lets the same predicate run on both the native add/use path and the commit-time bind. It also
//! keeps qfs-secrets wasm-buildable: nothing here touches the (native-only) envelope or any I/O.
