//! The connection-resolution ladder (blueprint §8): turn a statement's context into a
//! concrete [`ConnectionId`] for a driver, recording *why* (the [`ConnectionSource`]) so the
//! decision can be logged to the audit ledger ("who ran as whom") without ever touching
//! a credential.
//!
//! ## Precedence (highest wins)
//! 1. **`--connection` flag** — an explicit CLI override.
//! 2. **`AT 'acct'` clause** — the statement-level selector (its AST node comes from the
//!    grammar ticket t04; here we consume the resolved [`ConnectionId`]).
//! 3. **the mount's account** — the account the resolved mount binds (ADR 0008 §4: the mount
//!    carries the account; there is NO process-global selection state).
//! 4. **sole connection** — if the driver has exactly one configured connection, use it.
//! 5. **error** — zero connections → [`ResolveError::NoneConfigured`]; more than one with no
//!    selector → [`ResolveError::Ambiguous`] listing the candidates (never a silent pick).
//!
//! "Sole connection" means *sole for that driver*, scoped via the `available` slice the
//! caller filters to the driver — not globally. Resolution is pure (no I/O); the caller
//! reads `available` from the store once at COMMIT time and passes it in.
