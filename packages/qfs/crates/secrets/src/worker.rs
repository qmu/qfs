//! [`WorkerStore`] — the `wasm32` (Cloudflare Workers) [`Secrets`] backend (blueprint §8).
//!
//! On Workers there is **no filesystem** — so [`crate::LocalStore`]'s `0600`/AEAD-file
//! path is compiled out entirely (see `local.rs`'s `#![cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`)
//! and credentials come from the Worker's Secret Store / `env` bindings instead. This
//! store is a thin adapter over a caller-supplied resolver closure that reads a binding by
//! name; the host runtime (the `qfs serve` Worker entrypoint, a later ticket) wires the
//! actual `env.get(...)` call.
//!
//! Compiled only on `wasm32`. The trait surface is identical to every other backend, so a
//! driver depends on `&dyn Secrets` and is oblivious to which target it runs on.
