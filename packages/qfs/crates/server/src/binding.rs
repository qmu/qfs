//! The declarative **binding** seam (blueprint §10): the cause-attachment point E7 sibling
//! tickets implement (HTTP serving t31, cron firing t32, webhook/trigger ingestion t33).
//!
//! A [`Binding`] **converges to the registry** — there is no imperative add/remove API.
//! After every committed `/server` mutation the runtime calls [`Binding::reconcile`] with a
//! read snapshot of the new [`ServerState`], and the binding makes its live causes match
//! (e.g. the HTTP binding rebuilds its route table to equal `state.endpoints`). This keeps
//! the registry the single source of truth: a binding never holds the write guard, and it
//! is handed an owned snapshot so it cannot block a concurrent write across an `.await`.
