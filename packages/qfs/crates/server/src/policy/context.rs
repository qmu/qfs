//! The **resolved decision context** (t57) — the actor half of `evaluate`, kept strictly
//! separate from the pure enforcer so [`super::enforce::evaluate`] stays I/O-free.
//!
//! The richer ACL adds a *who* axis: a rule may be scoped to a user/role/group ([`Subject`]) and
//! gated on a `member_of('/directories/...')` predicate ([`Condition`]). Resolving *who the actor
//! is* and *which directories they belong to* is **I/O** (it reads identity/membership, t45/t55,
//! and — once t58 ships — a live `/directories/...` driver). That I/O happens **here, before**
//! the enforcer runs: the result is frozen into a [`DecisionContext`] of owned, secret-free data,
//! and the pure `evaluate` reads only that. This is the seam that keeps preview-as-CI able to
//! surface a policy denial with no live credentials.
//!
//! ## Default-deny preserved
//! [`DecisionContext::anonymous`] is the empty context — no user, no roles, no groups, no
//! memberships. Under it, only an `Anyone`/unconditional rule can match, so a richer (narrowed)
//! rule contributes nothing until a real actor is resolved: fail closed.
