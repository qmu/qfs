//! The structured SQL error (blueprint §6: machine-readable for an AI, never prose, and **never**
//! secret-bearing). This is the **pure-leaf** home of [`SqlError`] (extracted into `qfs-sql-core`
//! so both the SQL driver (t17) and the Cloudflare D1 driver (t23) reuse it without either crate
//! depending on the other). Every arm carries a stable [`SqlError::code`] and a secret-free
//! message — never a connection string, a password, a query parameter VALUE, or the rendered SQL
//! of a value-bearing statement.
//!
//! The runtime/secrets adapters (`From<SqlError> for qfs_runtime::EffectError`,
//! `From<qfs_secrets::SecretError> for SqlError`) live in the consuming **driver** crate
//! (`qfs-driver-sql`), NOT here — so this crate stays a pure leaf over `qfs-types` and carries no
//! runtime/secrets coupling.
