//! `qfs-store` — the embedded SQLite persistence substrate (roadmap **M0 / t42**).
//!
//! This is the single world the dashboard, CLI, and MCP agree on (roadmap decisions **E**
//! "all-SQLite, scrap the file vault" and **F** "stateless-at-scale: a trusted reverse proxy injects
//! the tenant→DB route; clients never name a DB"). It delivers the **two databases** roadmap §4.2
//! names:
//!
//! - [`SystemDb`] — per host: projects, cross-project config, the `/sys/*` surface.
//! - [`ProjectDb`] — per project: that project's connections, config, state.
//!
//! Both wrap a sync [`Db`] over a `rusqlite::Connection`. The crate is **sync by construction**:
//! rusqlite is sync, so tokio never enters here (the same confinement that keeps `qfs-cron` and the
//! `qfs-server` policy core pure). It is a **leaf** — only the terminal `qfs` binary opens a real DB
//! path (the dep-direction guard enforces this).
//!
//! ## The decision-F seam
//!
//! [`DbSource`] yields a connection **without the caller naming a file**. The binary supplies the
//! path ([`FileSource`]) or, in tests, an in-memory DB ([`MemorySource`]); a future reverse-proxy
//! tenant→DB injection is a *different* `DbSource` impl, not a code change. The invariant locked in
//! today is: *the binary never hard-codes a DB filename in a command path; the source is injected.*
//! (We deliberately do NOT implement distributed SQLite / D1 / EFS — that is later roadmap work.)
//!
//! ## What t42 ships
//!
//! The migrations [`migrate`] runner + `schema_version` bookkeeping + **empty** schema skeletons
//! ([`SYSTEM_MIGRATIONS`] / [`PROJECT_MIGRATIONS`]). The tables are *filled* by later M0–M3 tickets
//! (t43 secrets, t45 identity, t53 `/sys/*`) in their own migrations, so each PR's schema delta
//! stays reviewable. Opening a DB and running migrations is **start-time infrastructure**, NOT a qfs
//! effect-plan: it never goes through preview/commit; it is the substrate later `/sys/*` writes
//! preview and commit *over*.
