//! The versioned, checksum-verified, forward-only embedded-migrations runner (roadmap §4.2).
//!
//! A scope (System / Project) declares an **ordered** list of [`Migration`]s. [`migrate`] applies
//! the pending ones idempotently, each inside its own transaction (so a crash mid-migration rolls
//! back — decision E's "built fresh" must not mean "corruptible"), and is safe to call on **every**
//! start/relaunch: an already-applied migration is RE-VERIFIED by checksum rather than re-run.
//!
//! Invariants the runner enforces (fail-closed):
//! - **Forward-only.** Versions are a strictly-increasing sequence starting at 1, with no gaps; a
//!   malformed migration set is a programming error caught at startup, not silent drift.
//! - **Tamper-evident.** Each applied migration's `sha256_hex(sql)` is stored; a relaunch whose
//!   embedded SQL no longer matches the recorded checksum is a [`MigrationError::ChecksumMismatch`]
//!   (someone edited a shipped migration in place — forbidden; add a new version instead).
//!
//! ## Healing a botched in-place edit that already SHIPPED
//!
//! The tamper-evidence above assumes an in-place edit is caught *before* it reaches a real DB. Once
//! a botched edit ships in a release, two DB lineages exist in the wild — old-body and new-body —
//! and neither embedded checksum can satisfy both (reverting breaks the new-body release; keeping
//! the new body fail-closes every old-body DB). The narrow, audited escape hatch for *that already-
//! happened* case is [`SUPERSEDED_BODIES`]: a registry, keyed by the OLD body's checksum, of the
//! idempotent SQL that heals an old-body DB FORWARD to the current body. When the runner meets a
//! recorded checksum that is a registered superseded body, it runs the heal + re-stamps the
//! recorded checksum (in one transaction) instead of erroring. An UNLISTED mismatch still fails
//! closed, so tamper-evidence is intact for genuinely-unknown edits. See ticket `20260630203120`.
