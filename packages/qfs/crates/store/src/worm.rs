//! The **pure** WORM / transparency-log seam for audit-chain seals (roadmap **decision V** / §4.6,
//! ticket **t78**). qfs periodically *seals* the audit chain HEAD (t76) — a signed checkpoint
//! ([`qfs_oauth::AuditSeal`], minted binary-side) — and hands that seal OUT to an **append-only
//! witness outside the server**: an S3 Object Lock bucket, a transparency log, or a signed off-box
//! anchor. A hash chain alone can be re-forged wholesale by whoever controls the audit store; a seal
//! that has already landed in an *immutable, external* witness means a compromised server cannot
//! rewrite history below a sealed `seq` without contradicting an anchor it can no longer change.
//!
//! ## What this module is (the PURE half)
//! - [`SealRecord`] — the metadata-only line a seal becomes when it is handed to a witness: the
//!   sealed head's `(seq, content_hash, prev_hash)`, the `issued_at`, and the OPAQUE seal token (the
//!   compact ES256 JWS the AS signed; this crate never interprets it — `qfs-store` has no `qfs-oauth`
//!   edge, exactly like the `OauthKeyStore` trades only in opaque bytes).
//! - [`WormSink`] — the append-only emit seam every witness adapter implements. Object-safe so the
//!   binary selects the active witness at run time.
//! - [`WormError`] / [`WormKind`] — the secret-free failure + the witness discriminator.
//!
//! The IMPURE half — the concrete local append-only **file** witness, the parked external
//! (S3 Object Lock / transparency-log) seam, and the seal *trigger* that reads the head and signs it
//! — lives binary-side (`crates/qfs/src/worm.rs`), because only the terminal binary opens a real
//! path / socket, holds the AS key material, and reads the System DB (decision F/V), exactly as the
//! telemetry sinks and the audit chain-head I/O do.
//!
//! ## Emit, don't store (decision V)
//! The seal goes OUT; qfs keeps only the chain HEAD (t76) to continue the chain. **Where the witness
//! lives and how long it retains seals is the consumer's / platform's concern** (qfs Cloud on the
//! managed tier; the operator's own bucket self-hosted) — qfs produces the seals; it does not run the
//! WORM store.
//!
//! ## Metadata only (blueprint §8)
//! A [`SealRecord`] carries ONLY chain-position metadata + the public signature token. There is
//! structurally NOWHERE to put a secret or a row's payload — the same boundary the audit event and
//! the telemetry record enforce. The line is safe to append to a public transparency log.
