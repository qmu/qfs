//! The carried wasm-gating mechanical guard (t38; the precedent carried since t25/t33).
//!
//! Each wasm-gated leaf — `qfs-watchtower` (`native`), `qfs-host` (`host-daemon`),
//! `qfs-driver-slack` (`runtime`) — gates its non-wasm-clean deps (above all
//! **tokio**) behind an *optional* feature, so that with `--no-default-features` only the pure
//! core compiles and it builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. The load-bearing fence is the
//! **absence** of that feature (the deps are `optional`), not any marker (the t25/slack lesson).
//!
//! This guard makes the fence MECHANICAL rather than conventional: for each gated leaf it
//! computes the `--no-default-features` dependency closure (the package's own deps minus the
//! optional deps the gating feature would turn on, transitively) and asserts **tokio is not in
//! it**. So a regression that moves tokio out from behind the gate — or adds a new non-optional
//! tokio edge to a gated leaf — fails here, the same shape as `crates/plan/tests/purity_deps.rs`.
//!
//! It is intentionally a SOURCE-level closure (over `cargo metadata`'s declared `dependencies`),
//! not a `cargo build --target wasm32` (which the disk budget forbids and which CI does once):
//! the dependency graph is what makes the wasm build possible, so the graph is what we lock.
