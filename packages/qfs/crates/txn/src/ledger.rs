//! The applied-effect **audit ledger** (blueprint §7 recovery substrate, §8 audit).
//!
//! The ledger is the recovery-of-record: it records an [`EffectDescriptor`]
//! **before** the driver is touched (`record_intent`) and the [`EffectReceipt`]
//! **after** a successful apply (`mark_applied`). A crash mid-saga therefore leaves a
//! durable record the next run reads via [`AuditLedger::applied`] — an already-applied
//! [`EffectKey`] makes re-apply a no-op ([`LegOutcome::AlreadyApplied`](crate::LegOutcome::AlreadyApplied)).
//!
//! ## Crash-window reconcile (t12)
//! An intent recorded with **no** matching `applied` (a crash between `record_intent` and
//! `mark_applied`) is the genuinely hard case: the side effect may or may not have landed. The
//! runtime's resume gate queries [`AuditLedger::has_intent`] for exactly this window and, for a
//! leg that is **not** replay-safe ([`EffectDescriptor::is_replay_safe`] — a non-idempotent
//! `Insert`/`Call`/`Remove` with no conditional guard), refuses a silent replay, surfacing
//! [`LegOutcome::Indeterminate`](crate::LegOutcome::Indeterminate) for `UPSERT`-style re-apply
//! or operator confirmation (blueprint §7/§8 apply-once). A replay-safe leg (`UPSERT` or a
//! conditionally-guarded write) is re-applied: the driver-side dedup / `Conflict` catch makes
//! that convergent. So apply-once now holds for non-idempotent legs too, not only
//! driver-idempotent ones.
//!
//! Only the **contract** lives at E0 plus an in-memory default impl; the real **durable** sink
//! (append-only file / structured-log with fsync-intent-before-apply) is deferred to the E8
//! deployment ticket — the in-memory ledger here is process-local, so the reconcile guard is
//! exercised within a single process / test, not yet across a real OS crash. Keeping
//! [`AuditLedger`] the sole seam makes swapping the backend trivial. The ledger records
//! **metadata only** — never payloads or credentials (blueprint §8): the descriptor is already
//! redacted at its boundary.
