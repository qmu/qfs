//! [`TypeError`] — the **structured**, AI-consumable error of the type model (blueprint §6
//! "structured error", matching the closed-core/structured-error policy of t04).
//!
//! Errors are sum-typed and carry enough context (available columns, offending type,
//! the operator and operand types) for an AI agent to *repair* the statement rather
//! than re-parse prose. Every arm has a stable [`TypeError::code`] the server/CLI can
//! branch on and surface in audit logs (blueprint §8 observability).
//!
//! `qfs-types` is a leaf with no dependency on `qfs-driver`, so this does **not** use
//! the workspace `thiserror`-based `CfsError`; it is its own owned enum. The mapping
//! `TypeError → CfsError` is added at the `qfs-core` boundary in a later epic.
