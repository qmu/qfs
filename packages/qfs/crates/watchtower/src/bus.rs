//! The internal **event bus** (t34, blueprint §10): the [`EventBus`] trait (the seam the CF Queues impl
//! backs) + the EC2 [`LocalBus`] (tokio MPSC + a durable in-memory spool for crash-replay).
//!
//! ## At-least-once delivery
//! `publish` enqueues durably; `subscribe` yields events; `ack(id)` removes an event from the
//! spool. An un-acked event STAYS in the spool, so a simulated crash (drop the subscriber without
//! acking) leaves it redeliverable via [`LocalBus::redeliver_unacked`]. This is the at-least-once
//! guarantee the dispatcher relies on (ack only after a successful COMMIT).
//!
//! The trait is in the pure core (wasm-portable); [`LocalBus`] is `native`-gated (it owns the
//! tokio MPSC). The CF Queues impl (a `worker::Queue` producer + the consumer's `MessageBatch`)
//! lands in the deployment ticket behind this same trait.
