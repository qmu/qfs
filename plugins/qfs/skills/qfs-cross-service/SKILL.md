# Cookbook: Cross-service

This is what qfs is *for*. Because every service is the same kind of path, you can `JOIN` them in a
single statement. qfs pushes each side's filters down to its own service, then joins the results
locally — so a SQL table and a git repo combine as easily as two database tables.

The recipes here mix sources that **read today** (`/sql/<conn>/…`, `/git/<repo>/…`) with ones that
need a connected account (`/github/…`, `/slack/…`). Each is marked.

## Join a database to git history

**Match author records in a table to the commits they wrote** — `/sql` and `/git` both read, so this
runs end to end:

```qfs
/sql/orders/authors
|> join /git/myrepo/commits on name == author
|> select name, team, message
```

```text
name           | team     | message
-------------- | -------- | ---------------
Test <t@e.com> | platform | add feature
Test <t@e.com> | platform | initial commit
(2 row(s))
```

(`/sql/<conn>` is registered with `QFS_SQL_<CONN>`, `/git/<repo>` with `QFS_GIT_<REPO>` — see the
[Databases](/cookbook/databases) and [git](/cookbook/git) chapters.)

## Join a database to GitHub

**Match orders to the GitHub issues that track them:**

```qfs
/sql/orders/orders
|> join /github/acme/web/issues on id == issue_id
|> select id, title, status
```

::: warning Needs a connected account
The `/sql` leg reads today, but the `/github` leg returns *connect a GitHub account to read it — run
`qfs connection add github`* until you've authenticated. Once connected, the join runs end to end.
:::

## Combine the same shape from two sources

**Everyone, across two tables, de-duplicated** — `UNION` runs entirely on sources that read today:

```qfs
/sql/orders/orders
|> select customer
|> union /sql/orders/orders
|> select customer
```

```text
customer
--------
alice
bob
carol
dave
(4 row(s))
```

## Move data between services 🚧

Because reads and writes share one language, "copy from here to there" spans services too.

**Snapshot a database table to JSONL** — the read and the `ENCODE` both run:

```qfs
/sql/orders/orders
|> select id, customer, total
|> encode jsonl
```

```text
content
-------------------------------------------------
{"customer":"alice","id":1,"total":150.0}
{"customer":"bob","id":2,"total":80.0}
{"customer":"carol","id":3,"total":220.0}
{"customer":"dave","id":4,"total":55.0}
```

…then write those bytes to a store with an `UPSERT INTO`. (Today these are two steps; the point is
they speak the same language end to end. `UPSERT` into `/local` runs now; `/s3`/`/r2` writes are
not yet implemented — see [Files & object storage](/cookbook/files).)

::: tip How to know what joins
`qfs describe <path>` reports a node's verbs and its **pushdown** line — which filters run inside
the service vs. locally. It answers today for `/local`, `/mail`, and `/github` nodes; `describe` for
`/sql` and `/git` is still being wired (it returns `unknown_mount`), though the joins themselves
already run. Whatever the pushdown split, qfs over-fetches safely and re-checks locally, so you never
get wrong rows — only a bigger or smaller share of the work pushed down.
